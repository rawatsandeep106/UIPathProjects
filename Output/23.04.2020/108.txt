<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Interagency 
   Advisory on the Use of the Federal Reserve's Primary 
   Credit Program in Effective Liquidity Management</div>
<p>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
   the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the 
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office 
   of Thrift Supervision, and the National Credit Union 
   Administration (collectively, the Agencies) have 
   issued the attached <i>Interagency Advisory on the 
   Use of the Federal Reserve's Primary Credit Program 
   in Effective Liquidity Management</i>. The interagency 
   advisory presents information on the new Federal 
   Reserve primary and secondary discount window programs 
   and provides guidance on the appropriate use of primary 
   credit in an effective liquidity management program 
   to the directors, management, examiners and supervisors 
   of depository institutions. </p>
<p>The advisory explains that the new primary credit 
   program is designed to provide depository institutions 
   with an additional tool for managing short-term liquidity 
   risks through the extension of short-term credit 
   to eligible institutions at a rate above the target 
   federal funds rate. An important goal of the primary 
   credit program is to reduce institutions' reluctance 
   to use the window as a source of back-up, short-term 
   liquidity. Since primary credit can serve as a viable 
   source of back-up, short term funds, supervisors 
   and examiners should view the occasional use of primary 
   credit as appropriate and unexceptional. </p>
<p>The primary credit facility is only one of many tools 
   that institutions may utilize in managing their liquidity 
   risk profile. An institution's management should 
   ensure that the institution maintains adequate access 
   to a diversified array of funding sources, including 
   liquid assets such as high-grade investment securities 
   and a diversified mix of wholesale and retail borrowings. 
</p>
<p>If an institution incorporates discount window borrowings 
   in its contingency plans, the plans should be updated 
   in light of the new programs. Management also should 
   occasionally test the institution's ability to borrow 
   at the discount window to ensure that there are no 
   unexpected impediments or complications should such 
   lines need to be utilized. </p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to send a copy of this SR&nbsp;letter 
   and the interagency advisory to senior management 
   at domestic and foreign banking organizations supervised 
   by the Federal&nbsp;Reserve. If you have any questions, 
   please contact Jim&nbsp;Embersit, Assistant&nbsp;Director 
   (202-452-5249), or Mary&nbsp;Frances&nbsp;Monroe, 
   Senior Supervisory Financial Analyst (202-452-5231), 
   Market and Liquidity Risk Section.</p>
