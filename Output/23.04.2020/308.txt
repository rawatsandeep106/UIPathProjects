&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 111 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) generally requires that each
appropriate federal banking and thrift agency conduct a full scope,
on-site examination of federally insured depository institutions
under its jurisdiction at least once during each 12 month period.
In addition, as part of the recent review of examination and
supervisory policies and procedures, recommendations have been made
concerning the definition of what constitutes a full scope
examination for safety and soundness.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to comply with
section 111 of FDICIA and to implement these recommendations, the
Federal Reserve is adopting a minimum definition for a full scope
on-site examination. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of full scope examination articulated
below represents minimum guidelines for full scope, safety and
soundness examinations conducted by the Federal Reserve System.
The definition includes the traditional CAMEL evaluation and also
covers the safety and soundness requirements of FDICIA and other
supervisory concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;This definition formalizes certain
supervisory goals to achieve greater consistency in practice among
Reserve Banks without limiting each Reserve Bank's flexibility in
addressing its supervisory task.&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective in defining a full
scope, safety and soundness examination is to develop a minimum
guideline for full scope examinations that is sufficiently precise
to ensure the System meets FDICIA's requirement in a consistent and
comprehensive manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is the case under the current CAMEL framework, meeting
the objectives of a full scope examination will entail the use of
different examination procedures and techniques depending on the
size, condition, product orientation, and location of institutions.
Nevertheless, if the basic areas covered in this definition are
reviewed, full scope coverage will be achieved.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the definition of a full scope examination
includes the safety and soundness components of the Interagency
Uniform Rating System for CAMEL, the safety and soundness mandates
of FDICIA, and other regulatory priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition emphasizes assessing management's
performance as regards internal controls and compliance with laws
and regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The inclusion of these specific factors does not
limit the examiner's discretion in considering other information
that is relevant to the condition of the institution supervised,
nor does it symbolize a shift away from analyzing the essential
performance dimensions which CAMEL has traditionally considered.
Rather, it broadens the formal definition of full scope to include
related supervisory priorities, while retaining each Reserve Bank's
operational flexibility in meeting full scope objectives. <br>
<p>
<b>FULL SCOPE DEFINITION<br></b>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The following paragraphs set forth minimum guidelines
for full scope examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;These guidelines are based on
supervisory material adopted by the System when the Uniform
Interagency Bank Rating System (CAMEL) was developed and have
been expanded to reflect current supervisory priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;A full
scope examination involves the collection and analysis of data
sufficient to allow the examiner-in-charge (EIC) to determine a
rating for each of the five CAMEL components.&nbsp;&nbsp;To make this
determination the EIC should ensure that the following financial
and managerial factors are considered during the full scope
examination.&nbsp;&nbsp;The order of presentation of factors under each
component does not signify relative importance.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that a full scope examination would be
conducted on a consolidated basis, meaning that all subsidiaries
of the bank would be evaluated.&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of analysis of
subsidiaries and the necessity for on-site presence in such
subsidiaries and branches of the banking institution should be
determined by the EIC after an analysis of the materiality and
operational risk inherent in each.&nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases, an on-site
examination of material credit extending (issuing) subsidiaries
should be conducted.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<p>
<b>Capital Adequacy</b> <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of capital adequacy should include, but
is not limited to, a review of:<br>
<p>
<ol>
<li>assessment of the amount and adequacy of capital as
expressed by various capital measurement indices including
the appropriate ratios under the prompt corrective action
framework; <br>
<p>
<li>bank growth experience, plans, and future prospects; <br>
<p>
<li>quality and strength of earnings and earnings retention and
capital maintenance policy; <br>
<p>
<li>the volume of risk weighted assets; <br>
<p>
<li>management strength, including the ability to monitor and
control risk;  <br>
<p>
<li>financial strength of subsidiaries, parent, affiliates, and
other potential sources of additional capital;  <br>
<p>
<li>the risk exposure represented in off-balance sheet items;  <br>
<p>
<li>interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and risks
associated with nontraditional activities; <br>
<p>
<li>asset quality and growth; and  <br>
<p>
<li>adequacy of loan loss reserve. <br>
</ol>
<br>
<b>Asset Quality</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of asset quality should include, but is
not limited to, a review of:<br>
<p>
<ol>
<li>the level, distribution, and severity of classified assets
including an analysis of classified assets to total assets
and capital including compliance with the maximum classified
assets to capital ratio and other appropriate ratios; <br>
<p>
<li>the adequacy of internal controls, credit underwriting
standards and practices, and the quality of loan
documentation; <br>
<p>
<li>the level, composition, and trend of past due, nonaccrual
and reduced-rate assets; <br>
<p>
<li>bank's loan loss valuation methodology and charge-off
policies including past charge-off and reserve experience; <br>
<p>
<li>ability to identify, administer and collect problem credits; <br>
<p>
<li>concentration of on- and off-balance sheet credits or
investments including the magnitude and severity of the
concentrations; <br>
<p>
<li>nature and volume of special mention assets; <br>
<p>
<li>comprehensiveness of and adherence to lending, investment,
and trading policies;  <br>
<p>
<li>adequacy of credit administration, including real estate
owned, problem assets and real estate appraisal practices; <br>
<p>
<li>quality and control of off-balance sheet items, including
assets sold with recourse, derivative products and netting
policies and practices; and <br>
<p>
<li>exposure to insiders.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</ol>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A critical factor in the examination process is the
accuracy and reliability of credit review.&nbsp;&nbsp;The organization and
scope of the asset quality assessment varies at each financial
institution based on relevant risk factors such as the
institution's size and condition and complexities, concentrations
within the portfolio, recent trends in asset quality, the
adequacy of internal controls and loan documentation, the
appropriateness of lending policies, practices and underwriting
guidelines, and management structure and philosophy related to
lending.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate loan review coverage is needed for an
examination to be considered full scope.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure that
the loan review is of adequate scope examiners should refer to
the Federal Reserve's guidelines for selecting loan samples.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, examiners should select a loan sample of sufficient
size to enable the examiner to ascertain the bank's compliance
with applicable laws and regulations and to make an overall
assessment as to the safety and soundness of the banks's lending
function and the condition of its loan portfolio.<br>
<p>
<b>Evaluation of Management/Administration</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of management/administration should
include, but is not limited to, a review of: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<ol>
<li>technical competence, leadership and administrative ability; <br>
<p>
<li>compliance with relevant banking regulations and statutes; <br>
<p>
<li>effectiveness of internal controls, management information
systems and the strength and integrity of the internal and
external audit programs; <br>
<p>
<li>sufficiency of and adherence to the banks policies and
procedures; <br>
<p>
<li>ability to identify, measure and control financial<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></a> and
operating risks including the adequacy of formal risk
management systems; <br>
<p>
<li>use of the payments system and effectiveness of controls to
prevent misuse; <br>
<p>
<li>ability to effectively plan and respond to changing
circumstances, including strategic planning and the adequacy
of management information systems; <br>
<p>
<li>management depth and succession planning; <br>
<p>
<li>tendencies toward self dealing and transactions with related
organizations;  <br>
<p>
<li>compensation standards, including safeguards to prevent
against the payment of excessive compensation;  <br>
<p>
<li>management's philosophy with respect to dividends; <br>
<p>
<li>the accuracy of regulatory reports;  <br>
<p>
<li>the board of directors' discharge of its responsibilities; <br>
<p>
<li>compliance with outstanding supervisory improvement programs
(formal and informal); and   <br>
<p>
<li>the overall condition of the institution.<br>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Earnings</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of earnings should include, but is not
limited to, a review of:<br>
<p>
<ol>
<li>quality and future prospects for core income; <br>
<p>
<li>the ability to cover losses and maintain adequate capital
including compliance with the minimum earnings standard; <br>
<p>
<li>earnings levels and trends;  <br>
<p>
<li>the composition of earnings and sustainability of the
various earnings components; <br>
<p>
<li>peer group comparisons; <br>
<p>
<li>vulnerability to interest rate and other market or price
risks;   <br>
<p>
<li>the reliability of the bank's income and expense accounts,
including applicable accounting practices, internal
controls, and audit methods; <br>
<p>
<li>compliance with laws and regulations relating to earnings
and dividends; and <br>
<p>
<li>the effectiveness of management's budgeting process.<br>
</ol>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration must also be given to the
interrelationships that exist between the dividend payout ratio,
the rate of growth of retained earnings, and the adequacy of bank
capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration should be given to the adequacy of loan
loss provisions to the loan loss reserve and the extent to which
extraordinary items, securities transactions, and tax effects
contribute to net income.&nbsp;&nbsp;The links between earnings and
liquidity and the implications of a bank's funds management
decisions, particularly with respect to interest rate
sensitivity, should also be fully analyzed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
<b>Liquidity</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An evaluation of liquidity should include, but is not
limited to, a review of: <br>
<p>
<ol>
<li>the volatility and structure of deposits;  <br>
<p>
<li>reliance on interest sensitive funds and frequency and level
of borrowings;  <br>
<p>
<li>technical competence of management with respect to structure
of liabilities;  <br>
<p>
<li>access to money markets or other ready sources of cash;  <br>
<p>
<li>availability of assets readily convertible into cash at a
reasonable cost; <br>
<p>
<li>bank's reputation and image in market;  <br>
<p>
<li>outstanding commitments to provide funds; <br>
<p>
<li>funds management program to determine the adequacy of
contingency planning and the reasonableness of established
parameters;  <br>
<p>
<li>internal reports to determine if management is provided the
necessary information for informed funds management
decisions and if risks are appropriately monitored; and   <br>
<p>
<li>implications of overall financial condition or suitability
of funding sources. <br>
</ol>
<p>
 <b>Specialty Examinations</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full scope, on-site examination does not necessarily
include any of the specialty areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if a review of
specialty areas (e.g. EDP and Trust) has revealed less than
satisfactory performance, this performance should be considered
in assessing management strength and should be reflected in the
CAMEL rating. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition is applicable for all full scope, safety
and soundness examinations begun during 1994 and thereafter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
questions regarding the definition should be referred to Jim
Garner, Deputy Associate Director or Bill Spaniel, Assistant to
the Director, at the Board.<br>
