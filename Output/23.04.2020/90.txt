&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The federal banking agencies jointly issued guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information (Guidelines), which will become effective July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2001.<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp; A copy of the <i>Federal Register</i> notice is attached.&nbsp; The Guidelines implement section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which requires the agencies to establish standards for financial institutions relating to administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for customer records and information.&nbsp; The Guidelines were issued by the Federal Reserve as appendices to Regulations H and Y, and apply to customer information maintained by state member banks, bank holding companies, Edge and agreement corporations, and uninsured state-licensed branches and agencies of foreign banks.&nbsp; 

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Guidelines require institutions to establish an information security program to assess and control risks to customer information.&nbsp; Under the Guidelines, each institution may implement an information security program appropriate to its size and complexity and the nature and scope of its operations.&nbsp; The board of directors should oversee an institution's efforts to develop, implement, and maintain an effective information security program and approve written information security policies and programs.

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Guidelines outline specific security measures that banking organizations should consider in implementing a security program based on the size and complexity of their operations.&nbsp; Training and testing are also critical components of an effective information security program.&nbsp; The Guidelines specifically require financial institutions to oversee their service provider arrangements in order to protect the security of customer information maintained or processed by service providers. 

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Federal Reserve recognizes that banking organizations are highly sensitive to the importance of safeguarding customer information and the need to maintain effective information security programs.&nbsp; Existing examination procedures and supervisory processes already address information security.&nbsp; As a result, most banking organizations should not need to implement new controls and procedures.

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Examiners should assess compliance with the Guidelines during each safety and soundness examination or examination cycle (which may include targeted reviews of information technology) subsequent to the July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2001 effective date of the Guidelines and monitor ongoing compliance as needed during the risk-focused examination process.&nbsp; Material instances of non-compliance should be noted in the report of examination.&nbsp; The attached guidance was developed to assist examiners in documenting a financial institution's compliance with the Guidelines.

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this guidance to banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve in their districts.&nbsp; If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact Mike&nbsp;Wallas, Supervisory Financial Analyst, (202)&nbsp;452-2081 or Heidi&nbsp;Richards, Assistant Director, (202)&nbsp;452-2598.
