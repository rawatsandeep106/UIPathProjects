<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidentiality Provisions in Third-Party Agreements</div>
<p>The purpose of this letter is to clarify the Federal Reserve’s expectations regarding 
	confidentiality provisions in agreements between a banking organization and its 
   counterparties <span class="nobreak">(for example,</span> mutual funds, hedge funds, 
   and other trading counterparties) or other third parties. It is contrary to Federal 
   Reserve regulation and policy for agreements to contain confidentiality provisions 
   that <span class="nobreak">(1) restrict</span> the banking organization from providing 
   information to Federal Reserve supervisory 
   staff;<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
   <span class="nobreak">(2) require</span> or permit, without the prior approval of the 
   Federal Reserve, the banking organization to disclose to a counterparty that any information 
   will be or was provided to Federal Reserve supervisory staff; or 
   <span class="nobreak">(3) require</span> or permit, without the prior approval of the 
   Federal Reserve, the banking organization to inform a counterparty of a current or upcoming 
   Federal Reserve examination or any nonpublic Federal Reserve supervisory initiative or action.  
   Banking organizations that have entered into agreements containing such confidentiality 
   provisions are subject to legal risk.</p>
<p>Specifically, as noted in 
	<span class="nobreak"><a href="/BoardDocs/SRLetters/1997/SR9717.HTM">SR 97-17</a>,</span> "Access to 
   Books and Records of Financial Institutions During Examinations and Inspections," supervisory 
   staff may review <u>all</u> books and records maintained on the premises of a banking 
   organization that is subject to Federal Reserve supervision. This authority extends to any 
   and all documents on the 
   premises.<a href="#Footnote2" name="Footref2" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a> In addition, 
   under the Board’s Rules Regarding the Availability of Information, banking organizations are 
   prohibited from disclosing confidential supervisory information without prior written 
   permission of the Board’s General 
   Counsel.<a href="#Footnote3" name="Footref3" title="Footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a> Confidential 
   supervisory information is defined to include any information related to the examination of a 
   banking organization.<a href="#Footnote4" name="Footref4" title="Footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
   Staff has taken the position that identification of information requested by, or provided to, 
   supervisory staff &#150; including the fact that an examination has taken or will take place 
   &#150; is related to an examination and falls within the definition of confidential supervisory 
   information. </p> 
<div class="pagebreak"><div class="hidden">pagebreak</div></div>
<p>Some agreements between banking organizations and counterparties contain confidentiality 
	provisions that allow the banking organization to provide supervisory staff access to the 
   agreement and related information provided by the counterparty and relieve the organization 
   of any obligation to inform the counterparty when the banking organization is asked to furnish 
   such information to supervisory staff. For example, the Global Documentation Steering 
   <span class="nobreak">Committee (GDSC)<a href="#Footnote5" name="Footref5" title="Footnote 5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> 
   published standard confidentiality terms to promote prompt negotiation of confidentiality agreements. 
   The GDSC Confidentiality 
   <span class="nobreak">Terms (2004)<a href="#Footnote6" name="Footref6" title="Footnote 6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> 
   contain a provision stating that in the event that a supervisory authority with appropriate 
   jurisdiction requests access to or delivery of confidential information from an organization, 
   the organization may comply with such request and should give its counterparty written notice 
   of such request only "if lawfully permitted to do so."  Given that banking organizations are 
   not permitted without prior approval from the Federal Reserve to inform their counterparties 
   that Federal Reserve staff is reviewing, has reviewed, or has asked to review information 
   covered by an agreement, the GDSC Confidentiality Terms are consistent with regulatory 
   requirements for banking organizations entering into third-party agreements that contain 
   confidentiality provisions.</p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this <span class="nobreak">SR letter</span> to the 
	domestic and foreign banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve in their 
   districts as well as to supervisory and examination staff. Questions regarding this 
   <span class="nobreak">SR letter</span> may be directed to
