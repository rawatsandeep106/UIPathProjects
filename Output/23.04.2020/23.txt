            (2) Adjustments to schedules.--The Board may, by rule,

        thereof, revealed by such inspection that may be in violation of 
        this Act, the rules of the Board, the rules of the Commission, 
        the firm's own quality control policies, or professional 
        standards;

        (subject to section 105(b)(5)(A), and to the protection of such 
        confidential and proprietary information as the Board may 
        determine to be appropriate, or as may be required by law), 
        except that no portions of the inspection report that deal with 
        criticisms of or potential defects in the quality control

                response; or
                    (B) disagrees with the determination of the Board 
                that criticisms or defects identified in an inspection 
                report have not been addressed to the satisfaction of 
                the Board within 12 months of the date of the inspection 
                report, for purposes of subsection (g)(2).
            (2) Treatment of review.--Any decision of the Commission 
        with respect to a review under paragraph (1) shall not be 
        reviewable under section 25 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
        1934 (15 U.S.C. 78y), or deemed to be ``final agency action'' 
        for purposes of section 704 of title 5, United States Code.

                investigation involving a potential violation of the 
                securities laws, and thereafter coordinate its work with 
                the work of the Commission's Division of Enforcement, as 
                necessary to protect an ongoing Commission 
                investigation.
                    (B) Referral.--The Board may refer an investigation

                                    (II) the attorney general of 1 or 
                                more States; and
                                    (III) the appropriate State 
                                regulatory authority.

                and until presented in connection with a public 
                proceeding or released in accordance with subsection 
                (c).
                    (B) Availability to government agencies.--Without 
                the loss of its status as confidential and privileged in

                          (i) be made available to the Commission; and
                          (ii) in the discretion of the Board, when

                                    (III) State attorneys general in 
                                connection with any criminal 
                                investigation; and
                                    (IV) any appropriate State 
                                regulatory authority,
                each of which shall maintain such information as 
                confidential and privileged.
            (6) Immunity.--Any employee of the Board engaged in carrying 
        out an investigation under this Act shall be immune from any 
        civil liability arising out of such investigation in the same 
        manner and to the same extent as an employee of the Federal 
        Government in similar circumstances.

    (c) Disciplinary Procedures.--
            (1) Notification; recordkeeping.--The rules of the Board 
        shall provide that in any proceeding by the Board to determine

[[Page 116 STAT. 762]]

        whether a registered public accounting firm, or an associated 
        person thereof, should be disciplined, the Board shall--
                    (A) bring specific charges with respect to the firm 
                or associated person;
                    (B) notify such firm or associated person of, and 
                provide to the firm or associated person an opportunity 
                to defend against, such charges; and
                    (C) keep a record of the proceedings.
            (2) Public hearings.--Hearings under this section shall not 
        be public, unless otherwise ordered by the Board for good cause 
        shown, with the consent of the parties to such hearing.
            (3) Supporting statement.--A determination by the Board to 
        impose a sanction under this subsection shall be supported by a 
        statement setting forth--
                    (A) each act or practice in which the registered 
                public accounting firm, or associated person, has 
                engaged (or omitted to engage), or that forms a basis 
                for all or a part of such sanction;
                    (B) the specific provision of this Act, the 
                securities laws, the rules of the Board, or professional 
                standards which the Board determines has been violated; 
                and
                    (C) the sanction imposed, including a justification 
                for that sanction.
            (4) Sanctions.--If the Board finds, based on all of the 
        facts and circumstances, that a registered public accounting 
        firm or associated person thereof has engaged in any act or 
        practice, or omitted to act, in violation of this Act, the rules 
        of the Board, the provisions of the securities laws relating to 
        the preparation and issuance of audit reports and the 
        obligations and liabilities of accountants with respect thereto, 
        including the rules of the Commission issued under this Act, or 
        professional standards, the Board may impose such disciplinary 
        or remedial sanctions as it determines appropriate, subject to 
        applicable limitations under paragraph (5), including--
                    (A) temporary suspension or permanent revocation of 
                registration under this title;
                    (B) temporary or permanent suspension or bar of a

                public accounting firm;
                    (C) temporary or permanent limitation on the 
                activities, functions, or operations of such firm or 
                person (other than in connection with required 
                additional professional education or training);
                    (D) a civil money penalty for each such violation, 
                in an amount equal to--
                          (i) not more than $100,000 for a natural 
                      person or $2,000,000 for any other person; and
                          (ii) in any case to which paragraph (5) 
                      applies, not more than $750,000 for a natural 
                      person or $15,000,000 for any other person;
                    (E) censure;
                    (F) required additional professional education or 
                training; or
                    (G) any other appropriate sanction provided for in 
                the rules of the Board.

[[Page 116 STAT. 763]]

            (5) Intentional or other knowing conduct.--The sanctions and 
        penalties described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) and (D)(ii) 
        of paragraph (4) shall only apply to--
                    (A) intentional or knowing conduct, including 
                reckless conduct, that results in violation of the 
                applicable statutory, regulatory, or professional 
                standard; or
                    (B) repeated instances of negligent conduct, each 
                resulting in a violation of the applicable statutory, 
                regulatory, or professional standard.
            (6) Failure to supervise.--
                    (A) In general.--The Board may impose sanctions 
                under this section on a registered accounting firm or 
                upon the supervisory personnel of such firm, if the 
                Board finds that--
                          (i) the firm has failed reasonably to 
                      supervise an associated person, either as required 
                      by the rules of the Board relating to auditing or 
                      quality control standards, or otherwise, with a 
                      view to preventing violations of this Act, the 
                      rules of the Board, the provisions of the 
                      securities laws relating to the preparation and 
                      issuance of audit reports and the obligations and 
                      liabilities of accountants with respect thereto, 
                      including the rules of the Commission under this 
                      Act, or professional standards; and
                          (ii) such associated person commits a 
                      violation of this Act, or any of such rules, laws, 
                      or standards.
                    (B) Rule of construction.--No associated person of a 
                registered public accounting firm shall be deemed to 
                have failed reasonably to supervise any other person for 
                purposes of subparagraph (A), if--
                          (i) there have been established in and for 
                      that firm procedures, and a system for applying 
                      such procedures, that comply with applicable rules 
                      of the Board and that would reasonably be expected 
                      to prevent and detect any such violation by such 
                      associated person; and
                          (ii) such person has reasonably discharged the 
                      duties and obligations incumbent upon that person 
                      by reason of such procedures and system, and had 
                      no reasonable cause to believe that such 
                      procedures and system were not being complied 
                      with.
            (7) Effect of suspension.--
                    (A) Association with a public accounting firm.--It 
                shall be unlawful for any person that is suspended or 
                barred from being associated with a registered public 
                accounting firm under this subsection willfully to 
                become or remain associated with any registered public 
                accounting firm, or for any registered public accounting 
                firm that knew, or, in the exercise of reasonable care 
                should have known, of the suspension or bar, to permit 
                such an association, without the consent of the Board or 
                the Commission.
                    (B) Association with an issuer.--It shall be 
                unlawful for any person that is suspended or barred from 
                being associated with an issuer under this subsection 
                willfully to become or remain associated with any issuer 
                in an accountancy or a financial management capacity, 
                and for any issuer that knew, or in the exercise of 
                reasonable

[[Page 116 STAT. 764]]

                care should have known, of such suspension or bar, to 
                permit such an association, without the consent of the 
                Board or the Commission.

    (d) Reporting of Sanctions.--
            (1) Recipients.--If the Board imposes a disciplinary 
        sanction, in accordance with this section, the Board shall 
        report the sanction to--
                    (A) the Commission;
                    (B) any appropriate State regulatory authority or 
                any foreign accountancy licensing board with which such 
                firm or person is licensed or certified; and
                    (C) the public (once any stay on the imposition of 
                such sanction has been lifted).
            (2) Contents.--The information reported under paragraph (1) 
        shall include--
                    (A) the name of the sanctioned person;
                    (B) a description of the sanction and the basis for 
                its imposition; and
                    (C) such other information as the Board deems 
                appropriate.

    (e) Stay of Sanctions.--
            (1) In general.--Application to the Commission for review, 
        or the institution by the Commission of review, of any 
        disciplinary action of the Board shall operate as a stay of any 
        such disciplinary action, unless and until the Commission orders 
        (summarily or after notice and opportunity for hearing on the 
        question of a stay, which hearing may consist solely of the 
        submission of affidavits or presentation of oral arguments) that 
        no such stay shall continue to operate.
            (2) Expedited procedures.--The Commission shall establish 
        for appropriate cases an expedited procedure for consideration 
        and determination of the question of the duration of a stay 
        pending review of any disciplinary action of the Board under 
        this subsection.

SEC. 106. &lt;&lt;NOTE: 15 USC 7216.&gt;&gt; FOREIGN PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMS.

    (a) Applicability to Certain Foreign Firms.--
            (1) In general.--Any foreign public accounting firm that 
        prepares or furnishes an audit report with respect to any 
        issuer, shall be subject to this Act and the rules of the Board 
        and the Commission issued under this Act, in the same manner and 
        to the same extent as a public accounting firm that is organized 
        and operates under the laws of the United States or any State, 
        except that registration pursuant to section 102 shall not by 
        itself provide a basis for subjecting such a foreign public 
        accounting firm to the jurisdiction of the Federal or State 
        courts, other than with respect to controversies between such 
        firms and the Board.
            (2) Board authority.--The Board may, by rule, determine that 
        a foreign public accounting firm (or a class of such firms) that 
        does not issue audit reports nonetheless plays such a 
        substantial role in the preparation and furnishing of such 
        reports for particular issuers, that it is necessary or 
        appropriate, in light of the purposes of this Act and in the 
        public interest or for the protection of investors, that such 
        firm (or class of firms) should be treated as a public 
        accounting firm

[[Page 116 STAT. 765]]

        (or firms) for purposes of registration under, and oversight by 
        the Board in accordance with, this title.

    (b) Production of Audit Workpapers.--
            (1) Consent by foreign firms.--If a foreign public 
        accounting firm issues an opinion or otherwise performs material 
        services upon which a registered public accounting firm relies 
        in issuing all or part of any audit report or any opinion 
        contained in an audit report, that foreign public accounting 
        firm shall be deemed to have consented--
                    (A) to produce its audit workpapers for the Board or 
                the Commission in connection with any investigation by 
                either body with respect to that audit report; and
                    (B) to be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts 
                of the United States for purposes of enforcement of any 
                request for production of such workpapers.
            (2) Consent by domestic firms.--A registered public 
        accounting firm that relies upon the opinion of a foreign public 
        accounting firm, as described in paragraph (1), shall be 
        deemed--
                    (A) to have consented to supplying the audit 
                workpapers of that foreign public accounting firm in 
                response to a request for production by the Board or the 
                Commission; and
                    (B) to have secured the agreement of that foreign 
                public accounting firm to such production, as a 
                condition of its reliance on the opinion of that foreign 
                public accounting firm.

    (c) Exemption Authority.--The Commission, and the Board, subject to 
the approval of the Commission, may, by rule, regulation, or order, and 
as the Commission (or Board) determines necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest or for the protection of investors, either 
unconditionally or upon specified terms and conditions exempt any 
foreign public accounting firm, or any class of such firms, from any 
provision of this Act or the rules of the Board or the Commission issued 
under this Act.
    (d) Definition.--In this section, the term ``foreign public 
accounting firm'' means a public accounting firm that is organized and 
operates under the laws of a foreign government or political subdivision 
thereof.

Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78q(b)(1)) shall apply to the Board as 
fully as if the Board were a ``registered securities association'' for

[[Page 116 STAT. 766]]

            (3) Approval criteria.--The Commission shall approve a 
        proposed rule, if it finds that the rule is consistent with the 
        requirements of this Act and the securities laws, or is 
        necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the 
        protection of investors.
            (4) Proposed rule procedures.--The provisions of paragraphs 
        (1) through (3) of section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act 
        of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78s(b)) shall govern the proposed rules of

        securities association'' for purposes of that section 19(b), 
        except that, for purposes of this paragraph--
                    (A) the phrase ``consistent with the requirements of 
                this title and the rules and regulations thereunder 
                applicable to such organization'' in section 19(b)(2) of 
                that Act shall be deemed to read ``consistent with the 
                requirements of title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 
                2002, and the rules and regulations issued thereunder 
                applicable to such organization, or as necessary or 
                appropriate in the public interest or for the protection 
                of investors''; and
                    (B) the phrase ``otherwise in furtherance of the 
                purposes of this title'' in section 19(b)(3)(C) of that 
                Act shall be deemed to read ``otherwise in furtherance 
                of the purposes of title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 
                2002''.

        or addition to portions of the rules of the Board by the 
        Commission as fully as if the Board were a ``registered 
        securities association'' for purposes of that section 19(c), 
        except that the phrase ``to conform its rules to the 
        requirements of this title and the rules and regulations 
        thereunder applicable to such organization, or otherwise in 
        furtherance of the purposes of this title'' in section 19(c) of 
        that Act shall, for purposes of this paragraph, be deemed to 
        read ``to assure the fair administration of the Public Company 
        Accounting Oversight Board, conform the rules promulgated by 
        that Board to the requirements of title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
        Act of 2002, or otherwise further the purposes of that Act, the

        notice with the Commission of any final sanction on any 
        registered public accounting firm or on any associated person 
        thereof, in such form and containing such information as the 
        Commission, by rule, may prescribe.
            (2) Review of sanctions.--The provisions of sections 
        19(d)(2) and 19(e)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
        U.S.C. 78s (d)(2) and (e)(1)) shall govern the review by the 
        Commission of final disciplinary sanctions imposed by the Board 
        (including sanctions imposed under section 105(b)(3) of this Act 
        for noncooperation in an investigation of the Board), as fully 
        as if the Board were a self-regulatory organization and the 
        Commission were the appropriate regulatory agency for such 
        organization for purposes of those sections 19(d)(2) and 
        19(e)(1), except that, for purposes of this paragraph--

[[Page 116 STAT. 767]]

                    (A) section 105(e) of this Act (rather than that 
                section 19(d)(2)) shall govern the extent to which 
                application for, or institution by the Commission on its 
                own motion of, review of any disciplinary action of the 
                Board operates as a stay of such action;
                    (B) references in that section 19(e)(1) to 
                ``members'' of such an organization shall be deemed to 
                be references to registered public accounting firms;
                    (C) the phrase ``consistent with the purposes of 
                this title'' in that section 19(e)(1) shall be deemed to 
                read ``consistent with the purposes of this title and 
                title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002'';
                    (D) references to rules of the Municipal Securities 
                Rulemaking Board in that section 19(e)(1) shall not 
                apply; and
                    (E) the reference to section 19(e)(2) of the 
                Securities Exchange Act of 1934 shall refer instead to 
                section 107(c)(3) of this Act.
            (3) Commission modification authority.--The Commission may 
        enhance, modify, cancel, reduce, or require the remission of a 
        sanction imposed by the Board upon a registered public 
        accounting firm or associated person thereof, if the Commission, 
        having due regard for the public interest and the protection of 
        investors, finds, after a proceeding in accordance with this 
        subsection, that the sanction--
                    (A) is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
                of this Act or the securities laws; or
                    (B) is excessive, oppressive, inadequate, or 
                otherwise not appropriate to the finding or the basis on 
                which the sanction was imposed.

    (d) Censure of the Board; Other Sanctions.--
            (1) Rescission of board authority.--The Commission, by rule, 
        consistent with the public interest, the protection of 
        investors, and the other purposes of this Act and the securities 
        laws, may relieve the Board of any responsibility to enforce 
        compliance with any provision of this Act, the securities laws, 
        the rules of the Board, or professional standards.
            (2) Censure of the board; limitations.--The Commission may, 
        by order, as it determines necessary or appropriate in the 
        public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise 
        in furtherance of the purposes of this Act or the securities 
        laws, censure or impose limitations upon the activities, 
        functions, and operations of the Board, if the Commission finds, 
        on the record, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that 
        the Board--
                    (A) has violated or is unable to comply with any 
                provision of this Act, the rules of the Board, or the 
                securities laws; or
                    (B) without reasonable justification or excuse, has 
                failed to enforce compliance with any such provision or 
                rule, or any professional standard by a registered 
                public accounting firm or an associated person thereof.
            (3) Censure of board members; removal from office.--The 
        Commission may, as necessary or appropriate in the public 
        interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in 
        furtherance of the purposes of this Act or the securities laws, 
        remove

[[Page 116 STAT. 768]]

        from office or censure any member of the Board, if the 
        Commission finds, on the record, after notice and opportunity 
        for a hearing, that such member--
                    (A) has willfully violated any provision of this 
                Act, the rules of the Board, or the securities laws;
                    (B) has willfully abused the authority of that 
                member; or
                    (C) without reasonable justification or excuse, has 
                failed to enforce compliance with any such provision or 
                rule, or any professional standard by any registered 
                public accounting firm or any associated person thereof.

                the standard setting body is capable of improving the

            (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit a report on 
        the results of the study required by paragraph (1) to the

SEC. 109. &lt;&lt;NOTE: 15 USC 7219.&gt;&gt; FUNDING.

    (a) In General.--The Board, and the standard setting body designated 
pursuant to section 19(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended by 
section 108, shall be funded as provided in this section.
    (b) Annual Budgets.--The Board and the standard setting body 
referred to in subsection (a) shall each establish a budget for each 
fiscal year, which shall be reviewed and approved according to their 
respective internal procedures not less than 1 month prior to the 
commencement of the fiscal year to which the budget pertains (or at the 
beginning of the Board's first fiscal year, which may be a short fiscal 
year). The budget of the Board shall be subject to approval by the 
Commission. The budget for the first fiscal year of the Board shall be 
prepared and approved promptly following the appointment of the initial 
five Board members, to permit action by the Board of the organizational 
tasks contemplated by section 101(d).
    (c) Sources and Uses of Funds.--

[[Page 116 STAT. 770]]

            (1) Recoverable budget expenses.--The budget of the Board 
        (reduced by any registration or annual fees received under 
        section 102(e) for the year preceding the year for which the 
        budget is being computed), and all of the budget of the standard 
        setting body referred to in subsection (a), for each fiscal year 
        of each of those 2 entities, shall be payable from annual 
        accounting support fees, in accordance with subsections (d) and 
        (e). Accounting support fees and other receipts of the Board and 
        of such standard-setting body shall not be considered public 
        monies of the United States.
            (2) Funds generated from the collection of monetary 
        penalties.--Subject to the availability in advance in an 
        appropriations Act, and notwithstanding subsection (i), all 
        funds collected by the Board as a result of the assessment of 
        monetary penalties shall be used to fund a merit scholarship 
        program for undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in 
        accredited accounting degree programs, which program is to be 
        administered by the Board or by an entity or agent identified by 
        the Board.

    (d) Annual Accounting Support Fee for the Board.--
            (1) Establishment of fee.--The Board shall establish, with 
        the approval of the Commission, a reasonable annual accounting 
        support fee (or a formula for the computation thereof), as may 
        be necessary or appropriate to establish and maintain the Board. 
        Such fee may also cover costs incurred in the Board's first 
        fiscal year (which may be a short fiscal year), or may be levied 
        separately with respect to such short fiscal year.
            (2) Assessments.--The rules of the Board under paragraph (1) 
        shall provide for the equitable allocation, assessment, and 
        collection by the Board (or an agent appointed by the Board) of 
        the fee established under paragraph (1), among issuers, in 
        accordance with subsection (g), allowing for differentiation 
        among classes of issuers, as appropriate.

    (e) Annual Accounting Support Fee for Standard Setting Body.--The 
annual accounting support fee for the standard setting body referred to 
in subsection (a)--
            (1) shall be allocated in accordance with subsection (g), 
        and assessed and collected against each issuer, on behalf of the 
        standard setting body, by 1 or more appropriate designated 
        collection agents, as may be necessary or appropriate to pay for 
        the budget and provide for the expenses of that standard setting 
        body, and to provide for an independent, stable source of 
        funding for such body, subject to review by the Commission; and
            (2) may differentiate among different classes of issuers.

    (f) Limitation on Fee.--The amount of fees collected under this 
section for a fiscal year on behalf of the Board or the standards 
setting body, as the case may be, shall not exceed the recoverable 
budget expenses of the Board or body, respectively (which may include 
operating, capital, and accrued items), referred to in subsection 
(c)(1).
    (g) Allocation of Accounting Support Fees Among Issuers.--Any amount 
due from issuers (or a particular class of issuers) under this section 
to fund the budget of the Board or the standard setting body referred to 
in subsection (a) shall be allocated among and payable by each issuer 
(or each issuer in

[[Page 116 STAT. 771]]

a particular class, as applicable) in an amount equal to the total of 
such amount, multiplied by a fraction--
            (1) the numerator of which is the average monthly equity 
        market capitalization of the issuer for the 12-month period 
        immediately preceding the beginning of the fiscal year to which 
        such budget relates; and
            (2) the denominator of which is the average monthly equity 
        market capitalization of all such issuers for such 12-month 
        period.

    (h) Conforming Amendments.--Section 13(b)(2) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(b)(2)) is amended--
            (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``and'' at the end; and
            (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end 
        and inserting the following: ``; and
            ``(C) notwithstanding any other provision of law, pay the 
        allocable share of such issuer of a reasonable annual accounting 
        support fee or fees, determined in accordance with section 109 
        of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.''.

    (i) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to render either the Board, the standard setting body referred 
to in subsection (a), or both, subject to procedures in Congress to 
authorize or appropriate public funds, or to prevent such organization 
from utilizing additional sources of revenue for its activities, such as 
earnings from publication sales, provided that each additional source of 
revenue shall not jeopardize, in the judgment of the Commission, the 
actual and perceived independence of such organization.
    (j) Start-Up Expenses of the Board.--From the unexpended balances of 
the appropriations to the Commission for fiscal year 2003, the Secretary 
of the Treasury is authorized to advance to the Board not to exceed the 
amount necessary to cover the expenses of the Board during its first 
fiscal year (which may be a short fiscal year).

Periods.--
            (1) In general.--Except to the extent otherwise provided by 
        rule of the Commission pursuant to paragraph (3), it shall be 
        unlawful for any director or executive officer of an issuer of

        such equity security if such director or officer acquires such 
        equity security in connection with his or her service or

                any security of the issuer in the name and in behalf of 
                the issuer if the issuer fails or refuses to bring such 
                action within 60 days after the date of request, or 
                fails diligently to prosecute the action thereafter, 
                except that no such suit shall be brought more than 2
