<p>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the 
  Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Thrift Supervision, 
  and National Credit Union Administration, along with 
  the U.S.&nbsp;Department of the Treasury's Financial 
  Crimes Enforcement Network&nbsp;(FinCEN), have issued 
  the attached interagency Statement concerning the 
  provision of banking services to money services businesses&nbsp;(MSBs). 
</p>
<p>The interagency Statement 
  describes current issues relating to the provision 
  of banking services to MSBs and the views of the Federal 
  Reserve, the other federal financial institutions 
  supervisory agencies and FinCEN about assessing and 
  controlling the varying levels of risk associated 
  with such accounts. </p>
<p>To assist banking organizations, the agencies are 
  working to develop guidance that will articulate supervisory 
  expectations associated with MSB accounts. It is expected 
  that this guidance will be released concurrent with 
  FinCEN guidance for the money services business industry 
  further outlining that industry's compliance obligations. 
</p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this SR&nbsp;letter 
  to the domestic and foreign banking organizations 
  supervised by the Federal Reserve in your districts, 
  as well as to supervisory and examination staff. If
