   Section&nbsp;327 of the USA&nbsp;Patriot&nbsp;Act amends section&nbsp;3(c) of the Bank 
   Holding Company Act and requires that the Federal Reserve take into consideration the 
   effectiveness of an applicant company in combating money laundering activities, 
   including in its overseas branches, when the Board or a Reserve Bank acts on an 
   application filed under section&nbsp;3 of the Bank Holding Company Act.&nbsp; 
   Section&nbsp;327 also requires the Federal Reserve and the other federal financial 
   institutions supervisory agencies to consider the effectiveness of an insured 
   depository institution in combating money laundering activities, including in its 
   overseas branches, in connection with any application filed under the Bank Merger 
   Act.&nbsp; The provisions of section&nbsp;327 apply to all applications filed under 
   either of these two&nbsp;laws after December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2001.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The Federal Reserve has a longstanding practice of considering an applicant's 
   compliance with applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations in evaluating 
   various applications to acquire an insured depository institution, including bank 
   merger and bank holding company applications, as well as applications filed by foreign 
   banks to establish U.S.&nbsp;banking offices under the Foreign Bank Supervision 
   Enhancement&nbsp;Act.&nbsp; Consistent with this practice, the Federal Reserve will 
   apply the statutory requirements set forth in section&nbsp;327 of the 
   USA&nbsp;Patriot&nbsp;Act to all such applications.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   When evaluating applications filed with the Federal Reserve, Board and Reserve Bank 
   staff should continue to take into account the anti-money laundering record of the 
   applicant organization.&nbsp; In those cases where the applicant is a bank holding 
   company or state member bank, applications analysts must continue to review a Reserve 
   Bank's or state bank supervisor's examination findings relating to compliance with the 
   Bank Secrecy Act and the anti-money laundering program of the applicant 
   organization.&nbsp; Applications analysts should also contact relevant Federal Reserve 
   supervisory staff to obtain their assessment of the global anti-money laundering 
   policies and procedures of any U.S  banking organization filing an application or 
   notice with the Federal Reserve under applicable statutes.&nbsp; In addition, in order 
   to ensure compliance with the statutory standards of section&nbsp;327, Board and 
   Reserve Bank staff should contact pertinent foreign host country supervisors as 
   appropriate to obtain information about an applicant's anti-money laundering 
   activities at its overseas branches or bank subsidiaries.&nbsp; The anti-money 
   laundering compliance record of the depository institution being acquired should also 
   be scrutinized.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   In those cases where the applicant is a foreign bank proposing to establish initial 
   or additional U.S.&nbsp;branches, agencies, representative offices, or bank 
   subsidiaries, applications analysts must continue to review information provided by 
   the applicant on its global anti-money laundering polices and procedures as well as the 
   legal regime for anti-money laundering in its home country.&nbsp; For those applicants 
   with existing U.S.&nbsp;banking operations, analysts should review a Reserve Bank's, 
   state bank supervisor's, the OCC's or the FDIC's examination findings relating to 
   compliance with the Bank Secrecy&nbsp;Act by the applicant's U.S. operations and the 
   anti-money laundering program in place at such U.S. operations.&nbsp; In addition, 
   Board staff should contact the foreign bank's home country supervisor as appropriate to 
   obtain information about how the foreign bank's global anti-money laundering activities 
   are supervised.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   In those situations where the applicant is a national or state nonmember bank or 
   savings association, applications analysts should continue to review pertinent 
   examination findings by other regulators to determine the OCC's, FDIC's, OTS's or 
   state bank supervisor's assessment of the effectiveness of the bank's or thrift's 
   global anti-money laundering activities.&nbsp; After reviewing the other regulator's 
   examination findings, Board and Reserve Bank staff should as needed, contact the 
   appropriate examination staff of the other agencies to discuss the insured depository 
   institution's efforts in combating money laundering activities, including the 
   institution's efforts at its overseas branches, and the U.S. regulator's contacts with 
   foreign regulators.&nbsp;</P> 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   On a case-by-case basis, depending on information contained in examination reports and 
   obtained from other regulators, further information about the effectiveness of an 
   applicant's anti-money laundering activities may be required from the applicant to 
   complete the Federal Reserve's analysis of an application.&nbsp; The applications 
   record maintained by the Board and the Reserve Banks should continue to include 
   documentation relating to the review of an applicant's efforts to combat money 
   laundering activities, including information about contacts with other regulators.</P>

   This SR&nbsp;letter should be distributed to Reserve Bank staff responsible for 
   applications.&nbsp; If there are any questions, please contact Betsy&nbsp;Cross, 
   Deputy Associate Director, at (202)&nbsp;452-2574.</P>
