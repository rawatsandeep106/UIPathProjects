<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Framework for 
   Assessing Consumer Compliance Risk at Bank Holding 
   Companies</div>
<p>Changes in the banking and financial services industry 
   have highlighted the importance of incorporating 
   an assessment of consumer compliance risk in the 
   evaluation of a banking organization's overall risk 
   profile. To address these changes, the Federal Reserve 
   is enhancing its bank holding company supervision 
   program to ensure that examiners are focusing appropriately 
   on consumer compliance risk-related matters across 
   the broad range of a bank holding company's activities.</p>
<p>The Board's Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation 
   and Division of Consumer and Community Affairs have 
   developed an enhanced framework for the supervision 
   of consumer compliance risk at large complex banking 
   organizations&nbsp;(LCBOs) and at large banking organizations&nbsp;(LBOs) 
   that are subject to the System's continuous supervision 
   program. Under the framework (attached), consumer 
   compliance examiners will assess consumer compliance 
   risk across the broad range of a banking organization's 
   activities to determine the level and trend of consumer 
   compliance risk. In coordination with the central 
   point of contact and the supervisory team, consumer 
   compliance examiners will evaluate how this risk 
   impacts the organization's reputational, legal, and 
   operational risk profiles. Activities appropriate 
   to the level of the organization's consumer compliance 
   risk will be included in the supervisory plan developed 
   by the supervisory team to address the risks identified 
   in an organization's business activities. </p>
<p>The framework is being implemented in stages, with 
   the initial emphasis on LCBOs and certain LBOs. For 
   other bank holding companies with multiple insured 
   depository institution subsidiaries or nonbank subsidiaries, 
   surveillance and other information will be used by 
   the Reserve Banks to assess consumer compliance risk. 
   Consumer compliance risk will not be assessed in 
   shell holding companies. Federal Reserve supervisory 
   staff will consider the benefits of expanding the 
   framework to other bank holding companies and the 
   cost of doing so after the framework is implemented 
   in the LCBOs and applicable LBOs.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact Deborah&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Bailey, 
   Associate&nbsp;Director, Division of Banking Supervision 
   and Regulation, at (202)&nbsp;452- 2634, or Karen&nbsp;Murtagh, 
   Senior Review Examiner, Division of Consumer and 
   Community Affairs, at (202)&nbsp;452-3946.</p>
