&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, some financial institutions have restricted examiner access to
records maintained at the institutions by claiming that the documents are protected
from disclosure by certain legal privileges, such as the attorney-client privilege. 
Additionally, some financial institutions have expressed concern that, in the event
access is given, neither the Federal Reserve nor the institutions may be able to protect
documents obtained during the course of an examination or inspection from disclosure
to third parties, especially shareholders, customers, or other potential litigants.&nbsp; This
letter summarizes the Board's examination authority, identifies the privileges generally
asserted by banking organizations, and provides guidance to examiners for dealing
with an institution's claim of privilege as a basis for withholding information from an
examiner.<br>
<p>
<U>Examination Authority</U><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Federal Reserve's statutory examination authority, examiners
may review all books and records maintained on the premises of a financial institution
that is subject to Federal Reserve supervision.&nbsp; This authority extends to all
documents on the premises.&nbsp; The Board's broad examination authority, exercised
through the Federal Reserve Banks, is found under various statutes and regulations,
including:&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 11 of the Federal Reserve Act , which authorizes the Board to
examine the accounts, books, and affairs of each member bank; Section 5 of the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, which authorizes the Board to examine each bank
holding company and nonbank subsidiary thereof; Section 7 of the International
Banking Act of 1978, which authorizes the Board to examine each branch or agency
of a foreign bank; and Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act and Section 211.7 of
Regulation K of the Board of Governors, which authorize the Board to examine Edge
and Agreement corporations. <br>
<p>
<U>Legal Privileges Asserted by Banking Organizations</U><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following outlines the types of legal privileges that financial
institutions may cite to protect documents from disclosure to the Federal Reserve:<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></a>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Attorney-client privilege:&nbsp;&nbsp;The attorney-client privilege protects
communications between a client and its attorney, made without
third parties present, for the purpose of securing an opinion on the
law or legal services.&nbsp; The privilege also protects the attorney's oral
or written legal advice to the client.&nbsp; The privilege, which focuses on
communications between attorneys and their clients, is generally
waived if the client discloses the content of the communication to any
third-party.&nbsp; <br>
<p>
<li>Work-product privilege:&nbsp;&nbsp;The work-product privilege covers
documents prepared in anticipation of litigation by an attorney or
person hired by the attorney or client to assist in rendering legal
services.&nbsp; Disclosure to any adversarial party generally waives the
privilege as to all adversarial parties.&nbsp;  <br>
<p>
<li>Self-assessment privilege:&nbsp;&nbsp;Some states have enacted legislation to
create a new statutory privilege for self-assessments that protects
them from disclosure to third parties.&nbsp; Federal courts, however,
generally do not recognize any privilege for self-assessments that are
conducted by an institution without attorney participation.<a href="#Footnote2" title="Footnote 2" name="Footref2"><SUP>2</SUP></a> <br>
<p>
<li>Accountant-client privilege:&nbsp;&nbsp;Some states have enacted legislation to
create an accountant-client privilege that protects an accountant's
work from disclosure to third parties.&nbsp; Federal courts, however,
generally do not recognize any privilege for an accountant's work that
is conducted directly for a financial institution.&nbsp;  <br>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to recognize that claims of privilege are made traditionally
by persons resisting subpoenas or demands for production in the context of litigation. 
Should a banker refuse to provide a document needed by an examiner, the Board
could issue subpoenas pursuant to an order of investigation, and a court would decide
the issue should the examined institution resist the subpoena.&nbsp; An argument can be
made that the System's statutory authority to conduct on-site examinations overrides
any legal privilege the financial institution may have not to disclose the information. 
However, the law in this area is at present unclear.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that access to a financial institution's books and records that
an examiner believes is reasonably necessary to carry out an effective examination is
denied under an assertion of privilege, the examiner should immediately contact the
appropriate Federal Reserve Bank General Counsel, who should notify Herbert A.
Biern, Deputy Associate Director, at (202)&nbsp;452-2620, in order to coordinate a
response.<br>
<p>
<U>Disclosure to third parties by the Federal Reserve</U><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Documentation obtained from financial institutions during the course of
examinations or inspections, as well as examiner workpapers, memoranda, and
reports of examination or inspection, are considered by the Board to be confidential
supervisory information.&nbsp; It is the Board's practice to protect confidential supervisory
information from disclosure to third parties to the greatest extent possible consistent
with applicable law and the public interest. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been the long-standing practice of the Federal Reserve Banks,
your staff should continue to notify Stephen L. Siciliano, Special Assistant to the
General Counsel for Administrative Law, in the Board's Legal Division, at
(202)&nbsp;452-3920, concerning all requests for confidential supervisory information,
including court orders and subpoenas.<br>

The Equal Credit Opportunity Act was amended in 1996 to provide a limited privilege for any lender that conducts an adequate self-test, identifies discriminatory practices, and takes appropriate action.&nbsp; The Board will issue regulations in this area later this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref2">Return to text</a>
