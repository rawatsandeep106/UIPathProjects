&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve and the other federal bank and thrift
regulatory agencies have issued an interagency policy statement on
coordination and communication between external auditors and
examiners which is effective immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp; The policy statement
provides guidelines regarding information that should be provided
by depository institutions to their external auditors and meetings
between external auditors and examiners in connection with safety
and soundness examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the policy statement focuses on
depository institutions and their external auditors, bank holding
companies and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks that are
examined by the Federal Reserve are encouraged to provide similar
information to their external auditors and to make similar
arrangements regarding auditor attendance at meetings with
examiners.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy statement addresses external auditor
attendance at two broad categories of meetings between examiners
and institutions:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The policy statement generally encourages auditors to
attend examination exit conferences upon completion of
field work or other meetings between supervisory
examiners and an institution's management or Board of
Directors (or a committee thereof) at which examination
findings are discussed that are relevant to the scope of
the audit.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>
<p>
<li>When other conferences between examiners and management
are scheduled (i.e., meetings that do not involve
examination findings or that are not relevant to the
scope of the external auditor's work), the institution
must first obtain the approval of the appropriate agency
in order for the auditor to attend these meetings.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>
</ul>
<p>
With regard to the latter category of meetings, each Officer in
Charge of Supervision should establish a process for reviewing and
acting on requests by banking organizations  for external auditor
attendance at such meetings.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vast majority of cases, such
requests could be reviewed and approved by the examiner-in-charge.
In addition, appropriate documentation should be maintained on
meetings between external auditors and examiners, including
coordinated meetings between representatives of the federal bank
and thrift regulatory agencies and an institution's auditors.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy does not preclude the Reserve Bank from
holding meetings with the management of banking organizations
without auditor attendance or from requiring that the auditor
attend only certain portions of the meetings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the
policy statement specifically reiterates the requirement that
institutions and their external auditors maintain the
confidentiality of supervisory information.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of this policy statement should be given
immediately to each official and  examiner involved in the
supervision of state member banks, bank holding companies, and U.S.
branches and agencies of foreign banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a copy of
this guidance should be sent to the chief executive officer of each
state member bank and  bank holding company, and to the officer in
charge of U.S. branches and agencies of each foreign bank examined
by your district.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve and the other federal bank and thrift
regulatory agencies have issued an interagency policy statement on
coordination and communication between external auditors and
examiners which is effective immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp; The policy statement
provides guidelines regarding information that should be provided
by depository institutions to their external auditors and meetings
between external auditors and examiners in connection with safety
and soundness examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp; A copy of this interagency policy
statement is enclosed.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the policy statement focuses on depository

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with the interagency policy statement, banking
organizations  and their external auditors are reminded to maintain
the confidentiality of examination reports, inspection reports, and
supervisory discussions. <br>
