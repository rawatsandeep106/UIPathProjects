                  AND EXAMINATION STAFF AT EACH FEDERAL 
                  RESERVE BANK AND TO EACH DOMESTIC

<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking Accounts 
   for Foreign Governments, Embassies, and Political 
   Figures</div>
<p>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of 
   the Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Thrift 
   Supervision, and National Credit Union Administration, 
   in coordination with the U.S. Department of the Treasuryâ€™s 
   Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), have 
   issued the attached interagency advisory concerning 
   the embassy banking business and related banking 
   matters. The purpose of the advisory is to provide 
   general guidance to banking organizations regarding 
   the treatment of accounts for foreign governments, 
   foreign embassies, and foreign political figures.</p>
<p>The joint interagency statement advises banking organizations 
   that the decision to accept or reject an embassy 
   or foreign government account is theirs alone to 
   make. It goes on to advise that financial institutions 
   should be aware that there are varying degrees of 
   risk associated with such accounts depending on the 
   customer and the nature of the services provided, 
   and that they should take appropriate steps to manage 
   such risks consistent with sound practices and applicable 
   anti-money laundering laws and regulations. The advisory 
   also encourages banking organizations to direct questions 
   about embassy banking to their primary federal bank 
   regulators; thus, it is expected that you may receive 
   inquiries from banking organizations in your district.</p>
<p>To ensure that the System provides consistent information 
   on this subject, it is requested that the response 
   to inquiries from banking organizations be coordinated 
   through Herbert&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Biern, Senior Associate 
   Director, Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, 
   at the Board.</p>
<p>In addition to the issuance of the advisory by the 
   banking agencies, the U.S. Departments of State and 
   Treasury have issued the attached joint statement 
   on embassy banking.</p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this SR letter 
   to the domestic and foreign banking organizations 
   supervised by the Federal Reserve in your districts, 
   as well as to supervisory and examination staff. 
   If you have any questions, please contact Mr.&nbsp;Biern 
   at (202)&nbsp;452-2620.</p>
