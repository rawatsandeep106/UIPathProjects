&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On December 31, 1992, the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation published in the <i>Federal Register</i><a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></a> the final uniform
rule on real estate lending by insured depository institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The final rule
prescribes real estate lending standards as required by section 304 of the
FDIC Improvement Act (FDICIA).&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the publication of the final rule, Board
staff has received several questions concerning the effective date and the
application of the supervisory loan-to-value limits which warrant further
clarification.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The final rule becomes effective on March 19, 1993.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, as of this date,
insured depository institutions are expected to have in place written policies
that establish appropriate limits and standards for their real estate lending
activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;As prescribed in the real estate lending guidelines, an appendix to
the regulation, institutions are expected to establish internal loan-to-value
limits which should not exceed stated supervisory limits.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There has, however, been some confusion over whether these supervisory limits
apply to existing credits.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the final rule exempts extensions
of credits (including legally binding, but unfunded, lending commitments) originated prior to
March&nbsp;19,&nbsp;1993.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that such a loan has a loan-to-value ratio (LTV)
in excess of the supervisory LTV and is subsequently refinanced, renewed, or
restructured, the loan will continue to be treated as an excluded transaction
so long as there is no advancement of new funds or an increase in the line of
credit (except for reasonable closing costs), or the loan involves a workout
with a clearly defined and well-documented workout program.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A second question has arisen on what was meant by the language in the
guidelines regarding the calculation for the maximum loan amount where there
is a cross-collateralization of two or more properties with different
supervisory LTVs.&nbsp;&nbsp;The text states:<br>
<p>
<ul><ul>&quot;...the appropriate maximum loan amount under supervisory loan-to-value limits
is the sum of the value of each property, less senior liens, multiplied by the appropriate loan-to-value limit for each property.&quot;<br>
</ul></ul>
<p>
The current text may be misleading because the order of the arithmetical
operations could be taken to imply that the collateral value should be reduced
by the senior lien before applying the LTV limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was <i>not </i>the intent of
the agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;As intended by the agencies, the maximum loan amount is
determined by first multiplying each property's collateral value by the loan-to-value ratio appropriate to that property and then deducting
from that product any existing senior liens on that property.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of the
results of these calculations is the maximum loan amount that may be extended
under cross-collateralization.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There also have been several requests to clarify the guidelines' capital
limitations on loans in excess of supervisory LTV limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Institutions are
expected to identify those loans in excess of the supervisory LTV limits
(i.e., nonconforming loans) in their records.&nbsp;&nbsp;The aggregate amount of such
loans is not to exceed 100 percent of a bank's total risk-based capital
(referred to as the nonconforming basket).&nbsp;&nbsp;Within this limit, the aggregate
amount of non-1-to-4 family residential loans (e.g., raw land, commercial,
multifamily, and agricultural) that do not conform to supervisory LTV limits
may not exceed 30 percent of total risk-based capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining portion
of the nonconforming basket includes the aggregate amount of 1-to-4 family
residential construction loans and non-owner occupied 1-to-4 family
residential loans with a LTV greater than 85 percent and owner-occupied 1-to-4
family residential loans with a LTV equal to or exceeding 90 percent <b>without</b>
mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Reserve Banks should communicate these clarifications on the real estate
lending rule and guidelines to insured depository institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Attached is a
suggested transmittal letter that may be used for this purpose.<br>
