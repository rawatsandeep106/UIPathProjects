  of the Treasury's Financial Crime Enforcement Network 
  (collectively, the Agencies) have released an expanded 
  frequently asked questions document&nbsp;(FAQs) to 
  provide additional guidance on the customer identification 
  program rules issued under section&nbsp;326 of the 
  USA&nbsp;PATRIOT&nbsp;Act.<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
  The expanded FAQs, which incorporate the FAQs previously 
  released by the Agencies in 2004, are attached to

  to distribute this SR&nbsp;letter and the attached 
  FAQs on customer identification programs to the domestic 
  and foreign banking organizations supervised by the 
  Federal Reserve as well as to supervisory and examination
