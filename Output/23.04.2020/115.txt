<p>The Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
   Corporation, the&nbsp;Office of the Comptroller of 
   the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision 
   have issued the attached, amended policy statement, 
   <i>Internal Audit Function and its Outsourcing</i>. 
   The amended policy statement supersedes the interagency 
   policy statement on this subject that was issued 
   December&nbsp;22,&nbsp;1997 (SR&nbsp;letter&nbsp;97-35). 
   The amendments to the 1997 policy statement provide 
   more guidance to institutions seeking to enhance 
   the independence and effectiveness of their internal 
   audit function.</p>
<p>The 1997 policy statement was amended to bring supervisory 
   policy regarding the external auditor in concordance 
   with the prohibition on internal audit outsourcing 
   imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and pertinent 
   regulations of the U.S.&nbsp;Securities and Exchange 
   Commission. The FDIC guidelines implementing Section&nbsp;36 
   of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act refer to SEC 
   auditor independence regulations for the purpose 
   of meeting Section&nbsp;36's audit requirements. 
   As a result, banking organizations subject to Section&nbsp;36 
   -- essentially those with $500&nbsp;million or more 
   in assets -- should comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley 
   Act prohibition on internal audit outsourcing to 
   their external auditor. Institutions that are neither 
   subject to Section&nbsp;36 nor SEC registrants are 
   <i>encouraged</i> in the amended policy statement 
   not to use their external auditor to perform internal 
   audit services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In&nbsp;explaining the prohibitions on non-audit 
   services, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act describes three 
   broad principles that define potential conflicts 
   of interest for an external auditor. The principles 
   are that an external auditor should not: (i)&nbsp;audit 
   his or her own work; (ii)&nbsp;perform management 
   functions; or (iii)&nbsp;act in an advocacy role 
   for the client. Institutions should use these principles 
   as a framework for analyzing existing or proposed 
   non-audit services in order to avoid potential conflicts 
   of interest for the external auditor. </p>
<p>Other issues besides outsourcing internal audit to 
   the external auditor can significantly affect the 
   internal audit function. Management reporting and 
   corporate governance issues have an important bearing 
   on the independence of the internal audit function. 
   Staff competence and resources are key determinants 
   in the effectiveness of the internal audit function.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This guidance is effective immediately for all bank 
   holding companies, state member banks, and the U.S.&nbsp;operations 
   of foreign banking organizations. Reserve&nbsp;Banks 
   are asked to send a copy of this SR&nbsp;letter and 
   the amended interagency statement to senior management 
   at domestic and foreign banking organizations supervised 
   by the Federal&nbsp;Reserve. </p>
