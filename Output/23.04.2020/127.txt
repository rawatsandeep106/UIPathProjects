<p>The Federal Reserve Board, Office of the Comptroller 
  of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 
  Office of Thrift Supervision, and National Credit 
  Union Administration have issued the attached Interagency 
  Advisory on Accounting and Reporting for Commitments 
  to Originate and Sell Mortgage Loans. The advisory 
  provides guidance on the appropriate accounting and 
  reporting for both derivative loan commitments (that&nbsp;is, commitments to originate mortgage loans that will 
  be held for resale) and forward loan sales commitments 
  (that is, commitments to sell mortgage loans). Many 
  institutions have experienced difficulty in reporting 
  derivative loan commitments and forward loan sales 
  commitments, and the Federal Reserve reminds institutions 
  that they are expected to apply Generally Accepted 
  Accounting Principles when accounting for these transactions. 
</p>
<p>As specified in Statement of Financial Accounting 
  Standards No.&nbsp;133, <i>Accounting for Derivative 
  Instruments and Hedging Activities</i>, as amended 
  by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;149, 
  <i>Amendment of Statement&nbsp;133 on Derivative Instruments 
  and Hedging Activities</i>, institutions must account 
  for both derivative loan commitments and forward loan 
  sales commitments as derivatives. In addition, the 
  Federal Reserve expects all supervised institutions 
  to follow the related guidance in the SEC Staff Accounting 
  Bulletin No.&nbsp;105, <i>Application of Accounting 
  Principles to Loan Commitments</i>. </p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this SR letter 
  and the attached interagency advisory to state member 
  banks, bank holding companies, and foreign banking 
  organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve as 
  well as to supervisory and examination staff. Questions 
  pertaining to this letter should be directed to Arthur&nbsp;Lindo, 
  Manager Accounting Policy &amp; Disclosure Section, 
  (202)&nbsp;452-2695 or Greg&nbsp;Sierra, Financial 
  Analyst, (202)&nbsp;872-4972.<br>
