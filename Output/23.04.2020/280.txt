&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you are aware, System comments were requested on a proposed
rating system for examinations of Edge corporations and overseas
branches and subsidiaries of U.S. banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to inform you of
the System comments and to formalize the rating and report framework
for these international offices.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, Reserve Banks have favorably accepted CAMEO rating
methodology and some Reserve Banks have implemented these procedures
already.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rating methodology developed by the System task force
(Capital, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings and Operations and
Internal Controls - CAMEO) closely parallels the CAMEL rating
employed for examinations of commercial banks, except that a
separate rating component for operations and internal controls has
been substituted for liquidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the liquidity component
has been eliminated as a separate component, a review of liquidity
will still be performed as necessary in accordance with the
commercial bank examination procedures manual.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rating methodology and a revised examination report format
for U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banking organizations is
still being developed.&nbsp;&nbsp;A proposal on a rating system for U.S.
branches and agencies will be forwarded as soon as it is more fully
developed.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the need to establish a consistent uniform rating
methodology for System examinations of Edge corporations and
overseas subsidiaries and branches of U.S. banks, the attached CAMEO
Rating System should be adopted for all future examinations, with
the following clarifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<p>
<B>Edge Corporations</B>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examinations of Edge corporations (both banking and
nonbanking) should fully utilize the CAMEO system.&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital
component should presently be addressed in terms of the primary
capital/total capital measurement approach used in examinations of
commercial banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should also take into account all other
pertinent factors such as concentrations of credit, trading risks
and any risk-based capital figures provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach should
be used until the risk-based capital standards are applied to Edge
corporations.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rating system will be waived in the case of <I>dormant</I>
Edge corporations regardless of whether it is engaged in banking or
nonbanking.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CAMEO rating system (attached) will be included in the
revised Edge corporation manual which was released to the System in
June 1988 for testing and comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;The manual will be printed,
released to the System, and made available for purchase by the
public at a later date.
<p>
<p>
<B>Foreign Subsidiaries of U.S. Banks</B>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CAMEO rating system will be applied in its entirety to
examinations of all foreign subsidiaries of Edge corporations and
bank holding companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Targeted examinations having a limited
scope can omit ratings for components not reviewed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Merchant
banking operations would generally offer an example of where the
asset quality rating may not be relevant due to their insignificant
lending activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these types of operations, a review should
be performed to determine if any credit quality problems exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;If
none, the asset quality rating should be omitted.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing capital adequacy, it should be emphasized that
the primary capital/total capital approach should be the first step
and viewed as a reference tool and <I>not</I> as a strict capital adherence
measurement.&nbsp;&nbsp;The final capital adequacy rating should incorporate
an analysis by the examiner of the risk profile of the entity, i.e.,
credit risks, concentrations, interest rate risks and foreign
exchange and other money market trading activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those factors
may have more relevance in assessing capital than the quantitative
primary capital approach, particularly in merchant banking
operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, examiners should also factor into the
rating the foreign subsidiary's compliance with any minimum capital
standards established in the country where chartered.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
forthcoming capital requirements approved under Regulation K for
Edge corporations will also apply to foreign subsidiaries of Edge
corporations and bank holding companies.
<p>
<p>
<B>Overseas Branches of U.S. Banks</B>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the structural differences inherent in the various
international offices under the System's supervision, a &quot;0&quot; should
be assigned when a component is not applicable similar to the long-standing approach employed in the BOPEC rating.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, overseas
branches will have a &quot;0&quot; for the capital component of CAMEO.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rating asset quality, the primary criterion used
is the weighted classifications to capital funds ratio in accordance
with the CAMEL procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since branches do not maintain capital,
a proxy for branch capital may be calculated by taking the
proportion of branch total assets to total consolidated bank assets.
This percentage may then be applied to the capital funds of the
consolidated bank to determine the proportionate capital applicable
to the branch.&nbsp;&nbsp;This branch examination procedure which has been
used informally for years has worked well and should be adopted
formally.
<p>
<p>
<B>Disclosure of Composite Ratings</B>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosure of the numeric composite ratings for the above
international entities should be presented in the open section of
the examination reports, in accordance with the recent System policy
directive on disclosure of composite ratings on examinations and
inspections.&nbsp;&nbsp;The management of each institution under examination
should be made aware of the fact that this rating is furnished
solely for its confidential use.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, under no
circumstances should the institution or any of its directors,
officers, or employees disclose or make public the composite rating.
<p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any comments or questions regarding these examination rating
matters should be directed to Joe Sciortino (x2294).

CAMEO RATING SYSTEM
____________________________________________________________
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CAMEO rating system has been designed to provide a
general framework to summarize the examiner's views about key
components of an Edge corporation's operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rating system
is intended to reflect in a comprehensive and uniform manner an
institution's financial condition, compliance with laws and
regulations and overall operating soundness.&nbsp;&nbsp;(This methodology with
modifications for structural differences will also be applied to
other international operations, i.e. foreign subsidiaries and
branches of U.S. banks and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign
banks).&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, similar to the approach employed in the BOPEC rating
methodology when a component is not applicable, a &quot;0&quot; should be
assigned to the capital component of the CAMEO rating for overseas
branches of U.S. banks.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms and numerical ratings used to rate Edge corporations
are similar to those used in the Uniform Bank Rating System (CAMEL)
for commercial banks, but have been modified to reflect the special
characteristics of these corporations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The components rated are (in
this order): Capital, Asset quality, Management, Earnings, and
Operations and internal controls (CAMEO).
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each component should be rated on a scale of one through five
in ascending order of supervisory concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, one represents the
highest quality and lowest concern, while five represents the lowest
quality and greatest concern.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each corporation is also to be given a composite
rating based on an evaluation of the key components.&nbsp;&nbsp;
That numeric composite rating should be brought forward
to the Examiner's Comments page when discussing the corporation's
overall condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with disclosing the ratings, the
meaning of the ratings should
be clearly explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;The individual components of the CAMEO rating
are to be summarized  on the Analysis of Condition page.
Furthermore, the complete numerical
rating (CAMEO/Composite) should be included in Item 2
of the General Remarks section of the Edge Corporation Examination
Report.
<p>
CAPITAL ADEQUACY
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of capital plays a key role in the evaluation of any
financial institution; if its capital is sufficient, other
financial, managerial, and operational weaknesses can usually be
absorbed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, the ratings of other components, especially
asset quality and earnings, are closely related to capital.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of capital adequacy of an Edge corporation
differs somewhat between banking and nonbanking (investment)
corporations in view of their structural differences.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking Edge
corporations present a special case, in view of their depository
status which is non-insured.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve System has the
sole supervisory authority for these entities and would be
responsible for liquidating a failing Edge corporation.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding these structural differences, examinations of
all active corporations will include a capital adequacy assessment
and be rated for this component of the CAMEO rating.&nbsp;&nbsp;In doing so,
examiners are to follow the procedures employed in commercial banks
in assessing capital adequacy using the primary capital/total
capital quantitative measurement as the initial reference tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both types of Edge corporations, the examiner should measure
the corporation's capital relative to (a) the size and quality of
its consolidated assets and (b) the extent to which the
corporation's investment position and lending policies expose it to
further risks.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Edge corporations must meet the $2 million minimum capital
stock requirement of Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, and
banking Edge corporations must also maintain capital and surplus of
a minimum of seven percent of risk assets in accordance with
Regulation K.&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital of Edge corporations that do not meet
either of these standards may not be rated better than four
(marginal), regardless of the results of other calculations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
situation should also be temporary, and the corporation should have
immediate plans to eliminate this violation.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital ratings which parallel the capital ratings of state
member banks are as follows:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital is rated (1 through 5) in relation to: (a) the volume
of risk assets; (b) the volume of marginal and inferior quality
assets; (c) the corporation's growth experience, plans, and
prospects; and (d) the strength of management in relation to
(a),(b), and (c).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edge corporations rated 1 or 2 are considered to have adequate
capital, although the former's capital ratios will generally exceed
those of the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp;A 3 rating should be ascribed to a
corporation's capital position when the relationship of the capital
structure to points (a), (b)
or (c) is adverse even giving weight to management as a mitigating
factor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporations rated 4 and 5 are clearly inadequately
capitalized, the latter representing a situation of such gravity as
to threaten viability and solvency.&nbsp;&nbsp;A 5 rating also denotes that
the corporation requires urgent assistance from shareholder or other
external sources of financial support.
<p>
ASSET QUALITY
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asset quality is rated (1 through 5) in relation to
(a) the level, distribution and severity of classified assets; (b)
the level and composition of nonaccrual and reduced rate assets; (c)
the adequacy of valuation reserves; and (d) the demonstrated ability
to administer and collect problem credits.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rating asset quality, examiners should consider the credit
risk exposure of the corporation through its booked assets, as well
as its off-balance sheet activities, including credit risks
resulting from country exposure.&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach is consistent with
the procedures used to examine state member commercial banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Risks
to the corporation resulting from interest rate movements should not
be considered here, but rather in the evaluation of capital
adequacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, the rating for asset quality may be omitted
for corporations that are engaged primarily in trading or settlement
transactions and when credit risk is not an issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise,
examiners should measure the amount of risk inherent in classified
assets
and off-balance sheet exposures by assigning the following weights
to each classification category:
<p>
<TABLE border=0 width=300 align=center 
       summary="The following table is weights to each classification 
                category that measures the amount of risk inherent in

<p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total weighted classifications equal the aggregate of 20
percent of assets classified substandard, 50 percent of
assets rated doubtful and value impaired, and 100 percent
of assets rated loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 50 percent weight assigned to
assets classified Value Impaired reflects the exposure net
of any Allocated Transfer Risk Reserves.&nbsp;&nbsp;The weighted
classification ratio (weighted classifications as a percent
of total capital) is the primary criterion used to measure
asset quality.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of concentrations of the corporation's assets and the
volume of those assets rated as &quot;Other Transfer Risk Problems&quot;
(while not classified) should also be considered.&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the
weighted classification ratio and these and other factors that the
examiner considers relevant, one of the following ratings should be
assigned:

MANAGEMENT
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management should be evaluated on the basis of the
corporation's capital adequacy, asset quality, profitability, liquidity, adequacy of internal controls, and
adherence to policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rating should also reflect:
<p>
<ol>
<li>the technical competence of the management
team and the internal auditors;
<p>
<li>the degree to which management responds to
audit and examination criticisms and promptly
corrects cited deficiencies;
<p>
<li>management's demonstrated leadership abilities;
<p>
<li>management's ability to plan and respond to
changing circumstances, such as effectively
managing new products;
<p>
<li>the effectiveness of supervision by the board
of directors and the parent bank;
<p>
<li>the extent to which the corporation's policies
and procedures ensure management continuity; and
<p>
<li>tendencies toward self-dealing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</ol>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rating assigned should meet the description below:
<p>
Rating 1 (Strong) - Management is fully effective with respect to
the above criteria, taking into consideration the type, size, and
strategic thrust of the corporation.
<p>
<p>
Rating 2 (Satisfactory) - Management measures well under
the stated criteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the corporation exhibits minor
weaknesses, which management is adequately addressing.
<p>
Rating 3 (Fair) - Ratings for operations and internal controls and
for other components reflect management weaknesses, and the
corporation requires more than normal supervision.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the
corporation's overall condition and the quality of its management
should not impair its future viability.
<p>
Rating 4 (Marginal) - Significant managerial deficiencies have
contributed to a deterioration in the condition of
the corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management is not adequately addressing these
deficiencies.
<p>
Rating 5 (Unsatisfactory) - Management problems are sufficiently
severe that management must be immediately strengthened or replaced
to prevent further and serious deterioration in the condition of the
corporation.
<p>
EARNINGS
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earnings for both banking and nonbanking Edges are to be rated
based upon their volume and quality, with consideration given to
the parent company's policy and philosophy regarding the
corporation's profits.&nbsp;&nbsp;This rating reflects (a) the ability of
earnings to cover losses and to provide for adequate growth of
capital; (b) earnings trends; (c) the corporation's return on assets
and equity; and (d) the contribution of the corporation's earnings
and services to its parent institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the examiner in
rating earnings should consider the extent to which the profitability of the Edge corporation enhances or reduces the overall
profitability of its parent.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quantitative aspect of earnings should be based
on the corporation's return on assets ratio (net income divided by
average total assets) and its return on average equity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners
should determine, based on the structure and nature of the
corporation's operations, which of the two measures is the more
appropriate indicator as the first step in applying a rating to
earnings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Averages for corporations engaged in banking that do not
have branches or subsidiaries should be computed using the average
total assets on line 2(g) of the Memoranda section of each of the
quarterly call reports for a full calendar year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Average total
assets for all other corporations (including virtually all
nonbanking Edges) should be obtained on a consolidated basis from
records or data submitted by the corporation for inclusion in
quarterly reports of its parent.<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the profitability ratios of Edge corporations vary
widely, the corporations (or their subsidiaries) are essentially
banking institutions, and virtually all Edge corporations are
consolidated into the financial statements of other banking
organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, their earnings will have a clear
positive or a negative effect on the profitability ratios of their
parents and will either enhance or reduce the earnings performance
of their affiliates.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following guidelines reflect average
profitability measures for different sized U.S. banks and could be
used as an initial basis for measuring whether the corporation is
&quot;carrying its weight.&quot;  The final rating, however, should
incorporate other factors to reflect the general descriptions stated
below.

</TABLE>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The examiner should adjust these initial ratings to reflect the
second important factor--earnings quality--based upon such factors
as the adequacy of the corporation's valuation reserves and the
extent to which its net income results from securities transactions,
tax credits, and other items that may be non-recurring.&nbsp;&nbsp;An
inability to generate sufficient income from normal operations
constitutes a serious deficiency and should be reflected in the
earnings rating.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, since reported earnings may not fully
reflect the corporation's contribution to its parent's profits, the
examiner may upgrade the earnings rating by a maximum of two levels
to take into account any services provided by the corporation to its
parent or to its customers on behalf of the parent.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in
making
any adjustments, the examiner should assess the corporation's
performance relative to its budget plans and should also fully
explain the adjustment in the closed section of the report.
<p>
Rating Descriptions:
<p>
Rating 1 (Strong) - Earnings are characterized by high quality and
strong operating results.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are sufficient to make full
provisions for possible losses and the accretion of capital, given
the examiner's evaluation of asset quality and growth.
<p>
Rating 2 (Satisfactory) - Earnings are of high quality
and reflect satisfactory operating results.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are
also sufficient to make full provision for the absorption
of losses and the accretion of capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, any negative or
downward trend is transitory and does not reflect any serious future
earnings problems.
<p>
Rating 3 (Fair) - Earnings are not sufficient to make full
provision for the absorption of losses and the accretion of capital
in relation to asset growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;The earnings trends are static or
erratic, and asset quality may be less than satisfactory.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
quality of earnings may be weak, and operating results may raise
serious questions about future earnings.
<p>
Rating 4 (Marginal) - Earnings are generally above break-even,
but may be characterized by wide fluctuations or downward trends,
intermittent losses, or a substantial drop from the previous year.
In general, such earnings reflect poor operating results, are wholly
inadequate to make full provision for absorption of losses and
accretion of capital, and may rely heavily on tax credits, security
gains, or other non-recurring sources.
<p>
Rating 5 (Unsatisfactory) - The corporation has incurred losses or
has inadequate earnings which may erode capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;The parent
institution may need to provide assistance to rebuild capital and
improve the profitability of the corporation.
<p>
OPERATIONS AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of adequate operating procedures and internal
controls are critical elements in the overall evaluation of the
corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without them, the long-term safety and soundness of the institution is jeopardized, and any
successful performance can be only temporary.&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of
rating this component, the examiner should consider the extent to
which the corporation conducts its business in a safe and sound
manner and whether its records, reports, systems, and audit
procedures are adequate.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More specifically, the examiner should consider these factors:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the reliability and accuracy of the corporation's financial
records and the quality of its management information systems;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the completeness of the internal control system and the
adequacy of procedures that maintain the integrity of the system,
such as the separation of duties, the rotation of personnel, and the
dual control of sensitive responsibilities;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the adequacy of policies, procedures, and limits to
effectively control and monitor all activities, the extent to which
personnel adhere to those policies and procedures, and the
effectiveness of procedures to detect violations;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) the accuracy and timeliness of regulatory reports;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) the coverage and frequency of internal and external audits;
<p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) the adequacy of blanket bond and other indemnity insurance
coverage and the periodic review of such coverage by the board of
directors;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, such
as:<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Bank Protection Act<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Financial Recordkeeping and Reporting of
  Currency and Foreign Transactions Act<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Foreign Assets Control Regulations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Federal Election Campaign Act; and<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The physical and technological protection of electronic
data processing equipment, systems, and programs.

<p>

The rating assigned should meet the description below:
<p>
Rating 1 (Strong) - Operations and internal controls are sufficient
to ensure a high degree of safety and soundness with respect to the
nature and volume of current and planned activities.
<p>
Rating 2 (Satisfactory) - Operations and internal controls are
generally sufficient to ensure safety and soundness, but management
actions are necessary to correct certain deficiencies.
<p>
Rating 3 (Fair) - Deficiencies in operations and internal controls
may moderately compromise the safety and soundness of the
corporation if they are not corrected.
<p>
Rating 4 (Marginal) - Deficiencies in operations and internal
controls may severely endanger the overall safety and soundness of
the corporation unless management takes prompt corrective action.
<p>
Rating 5 (Unsatisfactory) - Operations and internal controls are
critically deficient and threaten the integrity of financial records
and the viability of the corporation.
<p>
COMPOSITE RATING
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Edge corporation must be given a summary or composite
rating that is based upon the ratings of individual components.
This rating should initially be
the average of the individual component ratings, but should then be
adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the general descriptions provided
below and any views of the examiner that the components should not
receive equal weight.&nbsp;&nbsp;The composite rating, therefore, should
reflect the examiner's judgement regarding the most appropriate
summary rating, rather than automatically represent an arithmetic
average.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the composite rating is different from that
average, an explanation should be given in the confidential section
of the report.&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerical composite rating should be reflected
in the open section on the Examiner's Comments page along with a clear
definition of the rating assigned.
<p>
The composite ratings are defined below:
<p>
Composite 1 (Composite range: 1 through 1.4) - The corporation is strong in almost every respect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any critical findings are
relatively minor and can be handled routinely.&nbsp;&nbsp;The corporation is
resistant to normal external economic and financial disturbances and
is better prepared to withstand the vagaries of business conditions
than Edge corporations with lower composite ratings.
<p>
Composite 2 (Composite range: 1.5 through 2.4) - The corporation
is fundamentally sound, but may reflect modest weaknesses
correctable in the normal course of business.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its business is
stable, and it should also be able to withstand business
fluctuations well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain areas of weakness, however, could create
concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that these minor problems are addressed in
the normal course of business, the supervisory response should be
limited.
<p>
Composite 3 (Composite range: 2.5 through 3.4) - The corporation
exhibits a combination of weaknesses ranging from moderately severe
to unsatisfactory.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only marginally resistant to adverse
business conditions, and could easily deteriorate if concerted
action is not effective in correcting the weaknesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently,
the corporation
is vulnerable and requires more than normal supervision.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its
overall strength and financial capacity, however, are still such
that its future viability should not be impaired.
<p>
Composite 4 (Composite range: 3.5 through 4.4) - The corporation
has an inordinate volume of asset weaknesses, or a combination of
other conditions that are less than satisfactory.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless prompt
action is taken to correct these conditions, the problems could
reasonably be expected to impair the corporation's future viability.
Close supervisory attention and possibly financial surveillance is
required.
<p>
Composite 5 (Composite range: 4.5 through 5) - The condition of
the corporation is worse than described under Composite 4, above.
The volume and character of its weaknesses require urgent aid from
the shareholders or other sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate corrective action and
constant supervisory attention is needed.
<p>
APPROPRIATE SUPERVISORY ACTION
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general rule, either formal or informal supervisory
action should be considered when routine actions, such as formal
discussions with the corporation's principals or directors and
normal follow-up procedures, have failed to resolve supervisory
concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Edge corporation rating system should clearly
identify those corporations with serious problems and should
distinguish them from institutions whose weaknesses or deficiencies
warrant less supervisory concern.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since prompt and effective remedial action may prevent the
condition of a weak corporation from deteriorating further, the
examiner should clearly define all material weaknesses and should
suggest corrective measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, a Memorandum of
Understanding between the corporation's board of directors and
Reserve Bank officials may
be needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This document is not a formal agreement as prescribed in
the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966, but rather is a
good-faith understanding between the corporation's directors and the
Reserve Bank concerning
the appropriate response to the corporation's principal problems.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporations rated composite 4 or 5 are clearly
problem institutions that require close and constant supervisory
attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in unusual circumstances, these corporations
are presumed to warrant formal supervisory action--that is, written
agreements or cease-and-desist orders, as provided for in the
Financial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966.&nbsp;&nbsp;If necessary, the
Board of Governors may suspend or remove offending officers and
directors of corporations for certain violations and activities.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the decision to pursue formal or informal supervisory
actions belongs to the Board of Governors
and the Reserve Bank, the initial consideration of whether such
action is necessary usually results from the examination process.
By carefully identifying both the corporation's weaknesses and
deficiencies as well as management's plans to correct those
problems, the examiner will contribute heavily to informed decision-making concerning the appropriate supervisory action.
