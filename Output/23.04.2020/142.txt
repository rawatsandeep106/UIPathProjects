<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Interagency Guidance on Nontraditional 
   Mortgage Product Risks</div>
<p>On September 29, 2006, the Federal Reserve and the other federal financial 
   institutions regulatory agencies issued the attached <i>Interagency Guidance 
   on Nontraditional Mortgage Product Risks</i>. This guidance addresses both 
   risk management and consumer disclosure practices that institutions should 
   employ to effectively assess and manage the risks associated with residential 
   mortgage loans that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal and sometimes 
   interest (referred to as nontraditional mortgage loans). Attachment&nbsp;1 
   provides the <i>Federal Register</i> notice.<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
   Attachment&nbsp;2 provides the interagency guidance. At the same time, the 
   agencies are also issuing an addendum to the 2005 <i>Interagency Credit Risk 
   Management Guidance for Home Equity Lending</i><a href="#Footnote2" name="Footref2" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
   to provide additional guidance to regulated institutions on consumer disclosure 
   practices for open-end home equity lines of credit that contain interest only 
   features. Refer to Attachment&nbsp;3.</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Products</div>
<p>Given the potential risks associated with nontraditional mortgage products, 
   the guidance addresses both risk management and consumer disclosure practices 
   that institutions should consider in their mortgage lending activity. For 
   purposes of this guidance, nontraditional mortgage loans include both &quot;interest-only&quot; 
   mortgages, where a borrower pays no loan principal for the first few years 
   of the loan, and &quot;payment option&quot; adjustable-rate mortgages&nbsp;(ARMs), 
   where a borrower has flexible payment options with the potential for negative 
   amortization. A borrower's payment on a nontraditional mortgage loan can increase 
   significantly when the loan begins to amortize, leading to what is commonly 
   referred to as &quot;payment shock.&quot; Payment option ARMs carry greater 
   potential payment shock if a borrower makes only minimum payments, resulting 
   in negative amortization.</p>
<div class="noindent"><b><i>Risk Management Practices</i></b>: The guidance highlights the key 
      risk areas that should be addressed by an institution in its underwriting 
      standards, loan terms, borrower qualification standards, documentation 
      requirements, and portfolio and risk management practices. In particular, 
      the agencies expect an institution's borrower qualification criteria to 
      include an evaluation of a borrower's repayment capacity and ability to 
      repay the debt by final maturity at the fully indexed rate, assuming a 
      fully amortizing repayment schedule. The criteria should include a credible 
      analysis of a borrower's capacity to repay the full amount of the credit 
      extended, including potential negative amortization. Recognizing that an 
      institution's underwriting criteria are based on multiple factors, an institution 
      may develop a range of reasonable tolerances for each factor used in the 
      borrower qualification process, such as loan-to-value ratios, debt-to-income 
      ratios, and credit scores. These tolerances should be based on prudent 
      and appropriate underwriting standards, taking into account both the borrower's 
      characteristics and the loan product's attributes.</div>
	 <br>
<div class="noindent"><b><i>Consumer Disclosure Practices</i></b>: Institutions 
   are reminded that consumer disclosures on these types of mortgage products 
   must comply with applicable consumer laws. In light of the risks that these 
   products pose to consumers, the guidance also contains recommended practices 
   for an institution to consider when providing information to consumers on 
   the product's terms&nbsp;(including the existence of any prepayment penalty 
   or premium to be paid for reduced documentation loans) and risks (including 
   the risk of payment shock and negative amortization). Such information should 
   be provided to consumers at critical decision-making points, such as when 
   a consumer is shopping for a mortgage or is deciding which monthly payment 
   option to choose in a particular month. Since open-end home equity lines of 
   credit&nbsp;(HELOC) with an interest-only feature may pose risks to consumers 
   similar to those of closed-end mortgages, the agencies are also issuing an 
   addendum to the 2005<i>&nbsp;Interagency Credit Risk Management Guidance for 
   Home Equity Lending</i> to address the timing and content of consumer communications 
   for interest-only HELOCs.</div>
<p>Federal Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this letter, the interagency 
   guidance, and addendum to the HELOC guidance to banking organizations supervised 
   by the Federal Reserve, as well as to their supervisory and examination staff.
