<font size=3><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During recent years, the Federal Reserve has increasingly emphasized the
importance of sound risk management processes and strong internal controls when
evaluating the activities of the institutions it supervises.&nbsp; This greater emphasis reflects
the view that properly managing risks has always been critical to the conduct of safe
and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new
technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of financial transactions have
changed the nature of banking markets.&nbsp; Accordingly, while an institution's financial
performance is an important indicator of the adequacy of management, it is essential
that examiners give significant weight to the quality of risk management practices and
internal controls when evaluating the management and overall financial condition of
banking organizations.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with the greater emphasis given to risk management in Federal
Reserve examination and supervisory policy statements, System examiners are
instructed beginning in 1996 to assign a formal supervisory rating to the adequacy of
an institution's risk management processes, including its internal controls.&nbsp; This step is
a natural extension of current procedures that incorporate an assessment of risk
management and internal controls during each on-site, full-scope examination.&nbsp; The
specific rating of risk management and internal controls should be given significant
weight when evaluating management under the bank (CAMEL) and bank holding
company (BOPEC) rating systems.&nbsp; Like the components of those systems, the risk
management rating should be based on a five point numeric scale.&nbsp; Guidelines for
assigning the rating are provided in the attachment, which also defines the five rating
categories and the specific elements to be evaluated when determining which rating to
assign.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria for rating risk management draw heavily from previously issued
statements and from other materials of the Federal Reserve, particularly SR 93-69
(Examining Risk Management and Internal Controls for Trading Activities of Banking
Organizations), SR 95-17 (Evaluating the Risk Management and Internal Controls of
Securities and Derivatives Contracts Used in Nontrading Activities), the Trading
Activities Manual, and SR 95-22 dealing with ratings for U.S. offices of foreign banks. 
These documents emphasize the importance of an active role by an institution's senior
management and board of directors, adequate policies and limits, accurate and
independent measurement procedures and assessments of risk, and strong internal
controls.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A greater focus on risk management does not, of course, diminish the
importance of reviewing capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, liquidity, and other
areas relevant to the evaluation of safety and soundness.&nbsp; Rather, the rating of the
risk management process will bring together and summarize much of the analysis and
many of the findings regarding an institution's process for managing and controlling
risks that are currently an important part of the examiner's review of these individual
areas.&nbsp; The formal rating is intended to highlight and incorporate  both the quantitative
and qualitative aspects of an examiner's review of an institution's overall process for
identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling risk and to facilitate appropriate
follow-up action.&nbsp; <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As before, the overall profitability, asset quality, and capital adequacy of a bank
or bank holding company should continue to influence the examiner's assessment of
management, but these indicators can to some extent be affected, either favorably or
adversely, by factors outside management's control.&nbsp; For this reason, the specific
evaluation of the risk management process should be a primary factor when rating
management, especially in the case of larger institutions whose activities and
organizational structures require more formal and extensive procedures.&nbsp; <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should apply this guidance flexibly to reflect appropriately each
institution's individual circumstances and the nature, scope, and complexity of its
operations.&nbsp; Risk management ratings should be assigned for examinations and
inspections commencing on or after January 2, 1996 to all state member banks and
bank holding companies, regardless of their size.&nbsp; Guidelines and procedures for
assigning the ratings are set forth in the attachment.&nbsp; <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should discuss in a clear and straightforward manner in the
appropriate open sections of the report the nature and severity of any problems or
deficiencies found and the steps required to correct them, particularly if the risk
management rating is less than satisfactory.&nbsp; Serious lapses or deficiencies in internal
controls, including inadequate separation of duties, can constitute an unsafe and
unsound practice and possibly lead to significant losses or otherwise compromise the
financial integrity of the institution.&nbsp; If appropriate, the institution should be advised that
the Federal Reserve will initiate supervisory actions if its failure to separate critical
operational duties creates the potential for serious losses or if material deficiencies or
situations that threaten the safe and sound conduct of its activities are not adequately
addressed in a timely manner.&nbsp; Such supervisory actions may include formal
enforcement actions against the bank or bank holding company, or its responsible
officers and directors, or both, and would require the immediate implementation of all
necessary corrective measures.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach outlined in this letter is generally consistent with procedures used
to evaluate the U.S. offices of foreign banks under the branch and agency (ROCA)
rating system, which evaluates an office's risk management and operational controls. 
These guidelines for risk management do not alter the basic interagency bank
(CAMEL) rating framework.&nbsp; However, the rapid pace of change in the financial
services industry, including the advent of new technologies, financial innovation,
globalization, and intensified competition all argue for greater emphasis on market
risks, risk management processes, and internal controls in the supervisory evaluation 
and rating of financial institutions.&nbsp; In view of these considerations, the Federal
Reserve will continue working with the other banking agencies to promote appropriate
revisions to the bank rating system in order to highlight the importance of market risks
and sound risk management processes and practices.<br>

holding companies in your District; a suggested transmittal letter is attached.&nbsp; Senior
officers in charge of supervision are asked to ensure that supervisory personnel and

I am attaching recently developed guidelines that direct examiners, beginning
next year, to provide separate supervisory ratings for the risk management process,
including internal controls, of all state member banks and bank holding companies. 
While examiners have long taken the quality of risk management and internal controls
into account in evaluating an institution's overall condition, this rating is intended to
highlight in the examination process the importance of risk management and to
facilitate appropriate supervisory follow-up actions.&nbsp; Examiners will give this rating
significant weight when determining the rating of management under the CAMEL or
BOPEC rating systems and are also directed to discuss their findings regarding an
institution's risk management process with management, especially if they view the
process as less than satisfactory.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guidelines stress the importance of sound risk management and
emphasize the need for adequate segregation of duties.&nbsp; They draw from long-standing supervisory procedures that have been updated by policy statements and
examination manuals in recent years to reflect new financial instruments and evolving
market practices. They also stress that the Federal Reserve will take appropriate
supervisory action if institutions fail to maintain adequate controls, including the
separation of critical duties.&nbsp; <br>

<center><b><font size = +1>Federal Reserve Guidelines for Rating Risk Management at<br>
State Member Banks and Bank Holding Companies</b></center></font>
<p>
<br>
<b>OVERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
Taking and managing risks are fundamental to the business of banking.&nbsp; Accordingly,
the Federal Reserve has always placed significant supervisory emphasis on the
adequacy of an institution's management of risk, including its system of internal
controls, when evaluating the management at state member banks and bank holding
companies.&nbsp; An institution's failure to establish a management structure that
adequately identifies, measures, monitors, and controls the risks involved in its various
products and lines of business has long been considered unsafe and unsound
conduct.&nbsp; Principles of sound management should apply to the entire spectrum of risks
facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity,
operational, legal, and reputational risk:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Credit risk</i></b> arises from the potential that a borrower or counterparty will fail to
perform on an obligation. <br>
<p>
<li><b><i>Market risk</i></b> is the risk to a financial institution's condition resulting from
adverse movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign
exchange rates, or equity prices.&nbsp;  <br>
<p>
<li><b><i>Liquidity risk</i></b> is the potential that an institution will be unable to meet its
obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or
obtain adequate funding (referred to as &quot;funding liquidity risk&quot;) or that it cannot
easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market
prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (&quot;market
liquidity risk&quot;). <br>
<p>
<li><i><b>Operational risk</b></i> arises from the potential that inadequate information systems,
operational problems, breaches in internal controls, fraud, or unforeseen
catastrophes will result in unexpected losses. <br>
<p>
<li><i><b>Legal risk</b></i> arises from the potential that unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, or
adverse judgements can disrupt or otherwise negatively affect the operations or
condition of a banking organization. <br>
<p>
<li><i><b>Reputational risk</b></i> is the potential that negative publicity regarding an
institution's business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the
customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions. <br>
</ul>
<p>
These risks and the banking activities associated with them are addressed in
greater detail in the Commercial Bank Examination and Bank Holding Company
Supervision Manuals, the Trading Activities Manual, and other guidance.&nbsp; In practice,
an institution's business activities present various combinations and concentrations of
these risks depending on the nature and scope of the particular activity.&nbsp; The following
discussion provides guidelines for determining a rating for management's formal or
informal systems for identifying, measuring and containing these risks.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
<b>ELEMENTS OF RISK MANAGEMENT</b><br>
<p>
When rating the quality of risk management at state member banks and bank holding
companies as part of the evaluation of the overall quality of management, examiners
should place primary consideration on findings relating to the following elements of a
sound risk management system:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>active board and senior management oversight; <br>
<p>
<li>adequate policies, procedures, and limits; <br>
<p>
<li>adequate risk measurement, monitoring, and management information systems;
and<br>
<p>
<li>comprehensive internal controls <br>
</ul>
<p>
Each of these elements is described further below, along with a list of considerations
relevant to assessing the adequacy of each element.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should recognize that the considerations specified in these
guidelines are intended only to assist in the evaluation of risk management practices,
and not as a checklist of requirements for each institution.&nbsp; Moreover, while all bank
holding companies should be able to assess the major risks of the consolidated
organization, examiners should expect parent companies that centrally manage the
operations and functions of their subsidiary banks to have more comprehensive,
detailed, and developed risk management systems than companies that delegate the
management of risks to relatively autonomous banking subsidiaries. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate risk management programs can vary considerably in sophistication,
depending on the size and complexity of the banking organization and the level of risk
that it accepts.&nbsp; For smaller institutions engaged solely in traditional banking activities
and whose senior managers and directors are actively involved in the details of day-to-day operations, relatively basic risk management systems may be adequate.&nbsp; In
such institutions, these systems may consist only of written policies addressing
material areas of operations such as lending or investing, basic internal control
systems, and a limited set of management and board reports.&nbsp; However, large
multinational organizations will require far more elaborate and formal risk management
systems in order to address their broader and typically more complex range of
financial activities and to provide senior managers and directors with the information
they need to monitor and direct day-to-day activities.&nbsp; In addition to the banking
organization's market and credit risks, risk management systems should also
encompass the organization's trust and fiduciary activities, including investment
advisory, mutual funds, and securities lending activities. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk management processes of large banking organizations would typically
contain detailed guidelines that set specific prudential limits on the principal types of
risks relevant to their activities worldwide.&nbsp; Furthermore, because of the diversity of
their activities and the geographic dispersion of their operations, these institutions will
require timely and relatively more sophisticated reporting systems in order to manage 
their risks properly.&nbsp; These reporting systems, in turn, should comprise an adequate
array of reports that provide the levels of detail about risk exposures that are relevant
to the duties and responsibilities of individual managers and directors.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such extensive systems of large institutions will naturally require frequent
monitoring and testing by independent control areas and internal, as well as external,
auditors to ensure the integrity of the information used by senior officials in overseeing
compliance with policies and limits.&nbsp; The risk management systems or units of such
institutions must also be sufficiently independent of the business lines in order to
ensure an adequate separation of duties and the avoidance of conflicts of interest.&nbsp;  <br>
<p>
<p>
<b>Active Board and Senior Management Oversight</b><br>
<p>
Boards of directors have ultimate responsibility for the level of risk taken by their
institutions.&nbsp; Accordingly, they should approve the overall business strategies and
significant policies of their organizations, including those related to managing and
taking risks, and should also ensure that senior management is fully capable of
managing the activities that their institutions conduct.&nbsp; While all boards of directors are
responsible for understanding the nature of the risks significant to their organizations
and for ensuring that management is taking the steps necessary to identify, measure,
monitor, and control these risks, the level of technical knowledge required of directors
may vary depending on the particular circumstances at the institution.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors of large banking organizations that conduct a broad range of
technically complex activities, for example, cannot be expected to understand the full
details of their institutions' activities or the precise ways risks are measured and
controlled.&nbsp; They should, however, have a clear understanding of the types of risks to
which their institutions are exposed and should receive reports that identify the size
and significance of the risks in terms that are meaningful to them.&nbsp; In fulfilling this
responsibility, directors should take steps to develop an appropriate understanding of
the risks their institutions face, possibly through briefings from auditors and experts
external  to the organization.&nbsp; Using this knowledge and information, directors should
provide clear guidance regarding the level of exposures acceptable to their institutions
and have the responsibility to ensure that senior management implements the
procedures and controls necessary to comply with adopted policies.&nbsp; <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors of institutions that conduct more traditional and less complicated
business activities may require significantly less knowledge of complex financial
transactions or capital markets.&nbsp; They may, however, be more involved in the day-to-day activities and decision-making of their institutions than are their counterparts at
larger organizations and should have a level of knowledge commensurate with the
nature of their involvement.&nbsp;  <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior management is responsible for implementing strategies in a manner that
limits risks associated with each strategy and that ensures compliance with laws and
regulations on both a long-term and day-to-day basis.&nbsp; Accordingly, management
should be fully involved in the activities of their institutions and possess sufficient
knowledge of all major business lines to ensure that appropriate policies, controls, and
risk monitoring systems are in place and that accountability and lines of authority are
clearly delineated.&nbsp; Senior management is also responsible for establishing and
communicating a strong awareness of and need for effective internal controls and high
ethical standards.&nbsp; Meeting these responsibilities requires senior managers of a bank
or bank holding company to have a thorough understanding of banking and financial
market activities and detailed knowledge of the activities their institution conducts,
including the nature of internal controls necessary to limit the related risks.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the quality of the oversight by boards of directors and senior
management, examiners should consider whether the institution follows policies and
practices such as those described below: <br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The board and senior management have identified and have a clear
understanding and working knowledge of the types of risks inherent in the
institution's activities and make appropriate efforts to remain informed about
these risks as financial markets, risk management practices, and the
institution's activities evolve. <br>
<p>
<li>The board has reviewed and approved appropriate policies to limit risks
inherent in the institution's lending, investing, trading, trust, fiduciary and other
significant activities or products. <br>
<p>
<li>The board and management are sufficiently familiar with and are using
adequate record keeping and reporting systems to measure and monitor the
major sources of risk to the organization. <br>
<p>
<li>The board periodically reviews and approves risk exposure limits to conform
with any changes in the institution's strategies, addresses new products, and
reacts to changes in market conditions. <br>
<p>
<li>Management ensures that its lines of business are managed and staffed by
personnel with knowledge, experience, and expertise consistent with the nature
and scope of the banking organization's activities. <br>
<p>
<li>Management ensures that the depth of staff resources is sufficient to operate
and manage soundly the institution's activities and that its employees have the
integrity, ethical values, and competence that are consistent with a prudent
management philosophy and operating style. <br>
<p>
<li>Management at all levels provides adequate supervision of the day-to-day
activities of officers and employees, including management supervision of
senior officers or heads of business lines. <br>
<p>
<li>Management is able to respond to risks that may arise from changes in the
competitive environment or from innovations in markets in which the
organization is active. <br>
<p>
<li>Before embarking on new activities or introducing products new to the
institution, management identifies and reviews all risks associated with the
activity or product and ensures that the infrastructure and internal controls
necessary to manage the related risks are in place . <br>
</ul>
<p>

<p>
<b>Adequate Policies, Procedures, and Limits</b><br>
<br>
An institution's directors and senior management should tailor their risk management
policies and procedures to the types of risks that arise from the activities the institution
conducts.&nbsp; Once the risks are properly identified, the institution's policies and its more
fully articulated procedures provide detailed guidance for the day-to-day
implementation of broad business strategies, and generally include limits designed to
shield the organization from excessive and imprudent risks.&nbsp; While all banking
organizations should have policies and procedures that address their significant
activities and risks, the coverage and level of detail embodied in these statements will
vary among institutions.&nbsp; A smaller, less complex banking organization that has
effective management that is heavily involved in day-to-day operations generally would
be expected to have only basic policies addressing the significant areas of operations
and setting forth a limited set of requirements and procedures.&nbsp; In a larger institution,
where senior managers must rely on widely-dispersed staffs to implement strategies in
an extended range of potentially complex businesses, far more detailed policies and
related procedures would generally be expected.&nbsp; In either case, however,
management is expected to ensure that policies and procedures address the material
areas of risk to an institution and that they are modified when necessary to respond to
significant changes in the banking organization's activities or business conditions.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following guidelines should assist examiners in evaluating the adequacy of
a banking organization's policies, procedures, and limits:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The institution's policies, procedures, and limits provide for adequate
identification, measurement, monitoring, and control of the risks posed by its
lending, investing, trading, trust, fiduciary and other significant activities. <br>
<p>
<li>The policies, procedures, and limits are consistent with management's
experience level, the institution's stated goals and objectives, and the overall
financial strength of the organization. <br>
<p>
<li>Policies clearly delineate accountability and lines of authority across the
institution's activities. <br>
<p>
<li>Policies provide for the review of activities new to the financial institution to
ensure that the infrastructures necessary to identify, monitor, and control risks
associated with an activity are in place before the activity is initiated. <br>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<b>Adequate Risk Monitoring and Management Information Systems</b><br>
<p>
Effective risk monitoring requires institutions to identify and measure all material risk
exposures.&nbsp; Consequently, risk monitoring activities must be supported by information
systems that provide senior managers and directors with timely reports on the financial
condition, operating performance, and risk exposure of the consolidated organization,
as well as with regular and sufficiently detailed reports for line managers engaged in
the day-to-day management of the organization's activities.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The sophistication of risk monitoring and management information systems
should be consistent with the complexity and diversity of the institution's operations. 
Accordingly, smaller and less complicated banking organizations may require only a
limited set of management and board reports to support risk monitoring activities. 
These reports include, for example, daily or weekly balance sheets and income
statements, a watch list for potentially troubled loans, a report for past due loans, a
simple interest rate risk report, and similar items.&nbsp; Larger, more complicated
institutions, however, would be expected to have much more comprehensive reporting
and monitoring systems that allow, for example, for more frequent reporting, tighter
monitoring of complex trading activities, and the aggregation of risks on a fully
consolidated basis across all business lines and activities.&nbsp; Financial institutions of all
sizes are expected to have risk monitoring and management information systems in
place that provide directors and senior management with a clear understanding of the
banking organization's positions and risk exposures. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the adequacy of an institution's measurement and monitoring of
risk and its management reports and information systems, examiners should consider
whether these conditions exist:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The institution's risk monitoring practices and reports address all of its material
risks. <br>
<p>
<li>Key assumptions, data sources, and procedures used in measuring and
monitoring risk are appropriate and adequately documented and tested for
reliability on an on-going basis. <br>
<p>
<li>Reports and other forms of communication are consistent with the banking
organization's activities, are structured to monitor exposures and compliance
with established limits, goals, or objectives, and as appropriate, compare actual
versus expected performance. <br>
<p>
<li>Reports to management or to the institution's directors are accurate and timely
and contain sufficient information for decision-makers to identify any adverse
trends and to evaluate adequately the level of risk faced by the institution. <br>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Adequate Internal Controls<br></b>
<p>
An institution's internal control structure is critical to the safe and sound functioning of
the organization generally and to its risk management system, in particular. 
Establishing and maintaining an effective system of controls, including the
enforcement of official lines of authority and the appropriate separation of duties--such
as trading, custodial, and back-office--is one of management's more important
responsibilities.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, appropriately segregating duties is a fundamental and essential element 
of a sound risk management and internal control system.&nbsp; Failure to implement and
maintain an adequate separation of duties can constitute an unsafe and unsound
practice and possibly lead to serious losses or otherwise compromise the financial
integrity of the institution.&nbsp; Serious lapses or deficiencies in internal controls, including
inadequate segregation of duties, may warrant supervisory action, including formal
enforcement action.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When properly structured, a system of internal controls promotes effective
operations and reliable financial and regulatory reporting, safeguards assets, and
helps to ensure compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and institutional policies. 
Ideally, internal controls are tested by an independent internal auditor who reports
directly either to the institution's board of directors or its designated committee, which
is typically the audit committee.&nbsp; However, smaller institutions whose size and
complexity do not warrant a full scale internal audit function may rely on regular
reviews of essential internal controls conducted by other institution personnel. 
Personnel performing these reviews should generally be independent of the function
they are assigned to review.&nbsp; Given the importance of appropriate internal controls to
banking organizations of all sizes and risk profiles, the results of audits or reviews,
whether conducted by an internal auditor or by other personnel, should be adequately
documented, as should management's responses to them.&nbsp; In addition, communication
channels should exist that allow negative or sensitive findings to be reported directly to
the board of directors or to the relevant board committee.&nbsp; <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In evaluating the adequacy of a financial institution's internal controls and audit
procedures, examiners should consider whether these conditions are met:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The system of internal controls is appropriate to the type and level of risks
posed by the nature and scope of the organization's activities. <br>
<p>
<li>The institution's organizational structure establishes clear lines of authority and
responsibility for monitoring adherence to policies, procedures, and limits.&nbsp; <br>
<p>
<li>Reporting lines provide sufficient independence of the control areas from the
business lines and adequate separation of duties throughout the organization--such as those relating to trading, custodial, and back-office activities.&nbsp; <br>
<p>
<li>Official organizational structures reflect actual operating practices. <br>
<p>
<li>Financial, operational, and regulatory reports are reliable, accurate, and timely; 
wherever applicable, exceptions are noted and promptly investigated. <br>
<p>
<li>Adequate procedures exist for ensuring compliance with applicable laws and
regulations. <br>
<p>
<li>Internal audit or other control review practices provide for independence and
objectivity.&nbsp; <br>
<p>
<li>Internal controls and information systems are adequately tested and reviewed;
the coverage, procedures, findings, and responses to audits and review tests
are adequately documented; identified material weaknesses are given
appropriate and timely high level attention; and  management's actions to
address material weaknesses are objectively verified and reviewed. <br>
<p>
<li>The institution's audit committee or board of directors reviews the effectiveness
of internal audits and other control review activities on a regular basis. <br>
</ul>

<b>RATING DEFINITIONS</b><br>
<p>
The rating for risk management is based on a scale of one through five in ascending
order of supervisory concern.&nbsp; Examiners should assign this rating to reflect findings
within all four elements of sound risk management described above.&nbsp; The risk
management rating should be reflected in the overall &quot;Management&quot; rating of the 
institution and should be consistent with the following criteria:<br>
<p>
<b>Rating 1 (Strong)</b>.&nbsp; A rating of 1 indicates that management effectively identifies and
controls all major types of risk posed by the institution's activities, including those from
new products and changing market conditions.&nbsp; The board and management are
active participants in managing risk and ensure that appropriate policies and limits
exist, and the board understands, reviews, and approves them.&nbsp; Policies and limits are
supported by risk monitoring procedures, reports, and management information
systems that provide management and the board with the necessary information and
analysis to make timely and appropriate responses to changing conditions.&nbsp; <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal controls and audit procedures are sufficiently comprehensive and
appropriate to the size and activities of the institution.&nbsp; There are few noted exceptions
to the institution's established policies and procedures, and none is material. 
Management effectively and accurately monitors the condition of the institution
consistent with standards of safety and soundness and in accordance with internal
and supervisory policies and practices.&nbsp; Risk management is considered fully effective
to identify, monitor, and control risks to the institution.<br>
<p>
<b>Rating 2 (Satisfactory)</b>.&nbsp; A rating of 2 indicates that the institution's management of
risk is largely effective, but lacking to some modest degree.&nbsp; It reflects a
responsiveness and ability to cope successfully with existing and foreseeable
exposures that may arise in carrying out the institution's business plan.&nbsp; While the
institution may have some minor risk management weaknesses, these problems have
been recognized and are being addressed.&nbsp; Overall, board and senior management
oversight, policies and limits, risk monitoring procedures, reports, and management
information systems are considered satisfactory and effective in maintaining a safe
and sound institution.&nbsp; Generally, risks are being controlled in a manner that does not
require additional or more than normal supervisory attention.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal controls may display modest weaknesses or deficiencies, but they are
correctable in the normal course of business.&nbsp; The examiner may have
recommendations for improvement, but the weaknesses noted should not have a 
significant effect on the safety and soundness of the institution. <br>
<p>
<b>Rating 3 (Fair)</b>.&nbsp; A rating of 3 signifies risk management practices that are lacking in
some important ways and, therefore, are a cause for more than normal supervisory
attention.&nbsp; One or more of the four elements of sound risk management are
considered fair, and have precluded the institution from fully addressing a significant
risk to its operations.&nbsp; Certain risk management practices are in need of improvement
to ensure that management and the board are able to identify, monitor, and control
adequately all significant risks to the institution.&nbsp; Weaknesses may include continued
control exceptions or failures to adhere to written policies and procedures that could
have adverse effects on the institution.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internal control system may be lacking in some important respects,
particularly as indicated by continued control exceptions or by the failure to adhere to
written policies and procedures.&nbsp; The risks associated with the internal control system
could have adverse effects on the safety and soundness of the institution if corrective
actions are not taken by management.<br>
<p>
<b>Rating 4 (Marginal)</b>.&nbsp; A rating of 4 represents marginal risk management practices that
generally fail to identify, monitor, and control significant risk exposures in many
material respects.&nbsp; Generally, such a situation reflects a lack of adequate guidance
and supervision by management and the board.&nbsp; One or more of the four elements of
sound risk management are considered marginal and require immediate and
concerted corrective action by the board and management.&nbsp; A number of significant
risks to the institution have not been adequately addressed, and the risk management
deficiencies warrant a high degree of supervisory attention.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The institution may have serious identified weaknesses, such as an inadequate
separation of duties, that require substantial improvement in its internal control or
accounting procedures or in its ability to adhere to supervisory standards or
requirements.&nbsp; Unless properly addressed, these conditions may result in unreliable
financial records or reports or operating losses that could seriously affect the safety
and soundness of the institution.<br>
<p>
<b>Rating 5 (Unsatisfactory)</b>.&nbsp; A rating of 5 indicates a critical absence of effective risk
management practices to identify, monitor, or control significant risk exposures.&nbsp; One
or more of the four elements of sound risk management are considered wholly
deficient and management and the board have not demonstrated the capability to
address deficiencies.&nbsp; <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal controls may be sufficiently weak as to jeopardize seriously the
continued viability of the institution.&nbsp; If not already evident, there is an immediate
concern as to the reliability of accounting records and regulatory reports and about 
potential losses that could result if corrective measures are not taken immediately.&nbsp; 
Deficiencies in the institution's risk management procedures and internal controls
require immediate and close supervisory attention.&nbsp; <br>
<p>
<p>
<b>REPORTING CONCLUSIONS</b><br>
<p>
For state member banks, a single numerical rating for risk management and the
rationale for the rating assigned should be provided on page D, &quot;Ratings and General
Information,&quot; of the confidential section of the bank examination report.&nbsp; The risk
management rating should also be an important factor when determining the overall 
management rating of the CAMEL rating system.&nbsp; Comments, conclusions, and
criticisms relating to a bank's risk management process should be brought to the
attention of management and included on the &quot;Management/ Administration&quot; page of
the report, as well as pages 1 and 1a, &quot;Examination Conclusions and Comments&quot; and
&quot;Matters Requiring Board Attention&quot; if considered appropriate.&nbsp; Comments in the close-out meeting with management and in the open sections of the examination report, in
sufficient detail to bring about proper corrective actions, are particularly important if the
examiner has assigned risk management a rating that is less than satisfactory.&nbsp; <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should also consider the extent to which weaknesses in a bank's
management of risk may indicate material noncompliance with one or more safety and
soundness guidelines covering internal controls and information systems, internal audit
systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth
or compensation, fees, and benefits.<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><sup>1</sup></a>  Organizational procedures directing and
enforcing an adequate separation of duties can be especially critical to some banking
activities, such as so-called &quot;front&quot; and &quot;back-office&quot; functions, and should be
specifically addressed by examiners.&nbsp; In instances in which material noncompliance is
identified, authority exists to require the state member bank to submit a compliance
plan within 30 days if such weaknesses are not being adequately addressed through
other means. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For bank holding companies, the separate numerical rating for risk
management, and the rationale for the rating assigned, should be included and
discussed on page B, &quot;Condition of Bank Holding Company,&quot; of the confidential
section of the bank holding company inspection report,  and should also be reflected in
the examiner's overall rating of management.&nbsp; Comments, conclusions, and criticisms
relating to an institution's risk management process should be brought to the attention
of management and included on the &quot;Policies and Supervision&quot; page of the inspection
report, as well as on page 1, &quot;Examination Conclusions and Matters Requiring Special
Board Attention&quot; if considered appropriate and particularly if the rating is less than
satisfactory.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reports of examination or inspection and in transmittal letters to boards of
directors of state member banks and bank holding companies reference should be
made specifically to the types and nature of corrective actions that need to be taken
by institutions to address noted risk management and internal control deficiencies. 
Where appropriate, institutions should also be advised that the Federal Reserve will
initiate supervisory actions if the failure to separate critical operational duties creates
the potential for serious losses or if material deficiencies or situations that threaten the
safe and sound conduct of their activities are not adequately addressed in a timely
manner.&nbsp; Such supervisory actions may include formal enforcement actions against
the bank or bank holding company, or its responsible officers and directors, or both,
and would require the immediate implementation of all necessary corrective measures.<br>
