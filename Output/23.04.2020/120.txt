   SUPERVISION AND APPROPRIATE SUPERVISORY AND EXAMINATION 
   STAFF AT EACH FEDERAL RESERVE BANK</div>
<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervision 
   of State-Chartered Banks</div>
<p>The supervisory staffs of the Federal Reserve Board, 
   the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the 
   Conference of State Bank Supervisors have developed 
   the attached recommended practices to assist in continued 
   implementation of the principles and goals of the 
   Nationwide State and Federal Supervisory Agreement 
   adopted in&nbsp;1996 and to enhance the overall state-federal 
   coordinated supervision of state-chartered banks.</p>
<p>The Nationwide State and Federal Supervisory Agreement 
   established a series of principles to promote coordination 
   in the supervision of interstate banks. Developments 
   since the adoption of the Agreement continue to underscore 
   the importance of effective supervisory coordination. 
   The State Federal Working Group, an interagency group 
   of state bank commissioners and senior officials 
   from the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, has developed 
   these recommended practices to reiterate and reaffirm 
   a common sense approach for collaboration. The practices 
   incorporate successful procedures and techniques 
   used by the Federal Reserve in working collaboratively 
   with the states in supervising state-chartered banking 
   organizations. As such this document reinforces the 
   longstanding commitment of federal and state agencies 
   to provide efficient, effective and seamless oversight 
   of state banks of all sizes, including those institutions 
   that operate in more than one state. These principles 
   are equally applicable and important with respect 
   to communication and coordination of the supervision 
   of state-chartered banks operating within a single 
   state.</p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked 
   to distribute this SR letter and the Recommended 
   Practices for the Seamless Supervision of State-Chartered 
   Banks to their supervisory and examination staff. 
   Questions may be directed to Richard&nbsp;Watkins, 
   Manager, Community Banking Organizations, at (202)&nbsp;452-3421, 
   or Molly&nbsp;Wassom, Associate Director, Community 
   and Regional Banking Organizations, at (202)&nbsp;452-2305.</p>
