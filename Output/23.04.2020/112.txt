<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspicious 
   Activity Reports and Enforcement Actions against 
   Individuals</div>
<p>All domestic and foreign banking organizations supervised 
   by the Federal Reserve are required to file Suspicious 
   Activity Reports&nbsp;(SARs) regarding known or suspected 
   criminal activities by current and former officers, 
   directors, employees and other institution-affiliated 
   parties&nbsp;(IAPs), and others.<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
   Board staff reviews SARs on a regular basis to identify 
   significant cases in order to ensure that appropriate 
   enforcement actions are brought against IAPs, subject 
   to the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve, whose 
   misconduct is reported in SARs. Staff also reviews 
   SARs to facilitate coordination with law enforcement 
   authorities investigating the matters reported on 
   the forms. The SARs identified by Board staff during 
   these reviews are referred to the Reserve Banks for 
   follow-up action. Reserve Banks also independently 
   review SARs filed by supervised institutions within 
   their districts on a regular basis to identify IAPs 
   whose misconduct warrants enforcement actions, and 
   they review SARs prior to an examination or inspection 
   of a state member bank, bank holding company and 
   other supervised institution in order to evaluate 
   a banking organization's compliance with the Board's 
   SAR reporting rules and the Bank Secrecy Act.<a href="#Footnote2" name="Footref2" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The Special Investigations Section of the Division 
   of Banking Supervision and Regulation has recently 
   had its responsibilities expanded and is now responsible 
   for enforcement actions against IAPs handled by the 
   Division.<a href="#Footnote3" name="Footref3" title="Footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
   This SR&nbsp;letter provides guidance to Reserve 
   Banks regarding the coordination of enforcement matters 
   with the Special Investigations Section once a SAR 
   against an IAP has been identified for follow-up 
   action.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Generally, Reserve Bank follow-up is required on 
   SAR filings involving IAPs when any of the following 
   criteria is met:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;the amount of the 
   loss is $25,000 or greater; (2)&nbsp;multiple SARs 
   have been filed on an individual, regardless of the 
   amount of loss; (3)&nbsp;the conduct resulted in 
   unjust enrichment; or (4)&nbsp;the conduct would 
   have resulted in a significant loss had it gone undetected 
   or had restitution not been paid. Once either Board 
   staff or a Reserve Bank identifies a SAR fitting 
   one of these criteria, then the Reserve Bank should 
   contact the financial institution to discuss the 
   details of the SAR and ascertain law enforcement's 
   involvement. Of course, Reserve Banks should continue 
   to contact banking organizations and law enforcement 
   authorities regarding a particular SAR filing when 
   other events raise supervisory concerns.</p>
<p>If law enforcement intends to prosecute the IAP, 
   the Reserve Bank should monitor law enforcement's 
   efforts and notify Board staff of law enforcement's 
   interest. If informed that a guilty plea is likely, 
   the Reserve Bank should provide law enforcement with 
   the following paragraph to be included in the plea 
   agreement:</p>
<blockquote> &quot;Defendant further agrees not to become 
   or continue serving as an officer, director, employee, 
   or institution-affiliated party, as defined in 12&nbsp;U.S.C. 
   Section&nbsp;1813(u), (the Federal Deposit Insurance 
   Act, as amended), or participate in any manner in 
   the conduct of the affairs of any institution or 
   agency specified in 12&nbsp;U.S.C. Section&nbsp;1818(e)(7)(A), 
   without the prior approval of the appropriate federal 
   financial institution regulatory agency as defined 
   in 12&nbsp;U.S.C. Section&nbsp;1818(e)(7)(D).&quot; 
</blockquote>
<p>The use of this language in a plea agreement obviates 
   the need for the Board or any other banking agency 
   to take a separate enforcement action barring the 
   individual from the banking industry. The aforementioned 
   paragraph was drafted in consultation with the other 
   federal financial institutions supervisory agencies 
   and the U.S. Department of Justice.<a href="#Footnote4" name="Footref4" title="Footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
   Reserve Banks should also notify Board staff if a 
   conviction is obtained.</p>
<p>If 
   law enforcement declines to prosecute an IAP identified 
   in a SAR filing meeting one or more of the above-mentioned 
   criteria, the Reserve Bank should do the following:</p>
   
<ul class="indent">
   <li>Gather all appropriate documents from the filing 
      financial institution and the law enforcement 
      agency related to the SAR filing, including a 
      copy of the signed confession, if applicable, 
      records relating to any admission made to banking 
      officials, and any other pertinent supporting 
      materials, such as affidavits, investigative reports, 
      bank records, and the names of banking officials 
      with knowledge of the misconduct or internal investigation; 
   </li>
   <li>Follow-up with the financial institution to ascertain 
      whether any civil action has been taken by the 
      organization against the individual, and whether 
      the financial institution has obtained any restitution, 
      either through the voluntary cooperation of the 
      individual or by means of a court judgment;</li>
   <li>Determine the current home address of the individual;</li>
   <li>Determine if the individual is being represented 
      by legal counsel and identify the legal counsel 
      contact information (i.e., address and telephone 
      number); and </li>
   <li>To the extent possible, ascertain the individual's 
      current employment status and his or her ability 
      to pay restitution or a civil money penalty.<a href="#Footnote5" name="Footref5" title="Footnote 5"><sup>5</sup></a>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>After obtaining the documentation available from 
   the financial institution, and considering whatever 
   additional information that the Reserve Bank has 
   about the IAP, the Reserve Bank should evaluate the 
   quality of the documentation, weigh any other relevant 
   circumstances and determine whether to recommend 
   that the Board take an enforcement action against 
   the IAP. Possible actions include a permanent ban 
   from the banking industry through a prohibition order 
   or a cease and desist order requiring restitution 
   and corrective actions addressing the IAP's misconduct 
   and future employment. If the Reserve Bank decides 
   to recommend an enforcement action, then the Reserve 
   Bank should continue to follow current procedures 
   relating to the submission of enforcement action 
   recommendations to Board staff, which include a memorandum 
   summarizing the facts, along with a copy of the supporting 
   documentation. The Reserve Bank should also notify 
   Board staff when it recommends that no action be 
   taken.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this letter 
   to appropriate supervisory and examination staff. 
   For SARs and related enforcement action recommendations 
   meeting the criteria described in this SR&nbsp;letter, 
   Reserve Bank staff should contact Carmina&nbsp;Hughes, 
   Special Counsel and Manager of the Special Investigations 
   Section, at (202)&nbsp;452-5235, or John&nbsp;Davidson, 
   Senior Attorney, at (202)&nbsp;452-2808. Questions 
   can also be directed to Herbert&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Biern, 
   Senior Associate Director, at (202)&nbsp;452-2620 
   or to Ms.&nbsp;Hughes or Mr.&nbsp;Davidson.</p>

      <li><a name="Footnote1"></a>Sections&nbsp;1813(u) 
         and 1818(b)(3) and (4) of Title&nbsp;12 of 
         the United&nbsp;States Code generally define 
         an IAP subject to the enforcement jurisdiction 
         of the Federal Reserve as any officer, director, 
         employee, controlling shareholder, independent 
         contractor such as an attorney or accountant 
         under certain limited circumstances, or any 
         other person who participates in the conduct 
         of the affairs of an insured depository institution, 
         bank holding company, nonbank subsidiary of 
         a bank holding company, or a U.S. branch or 
         agency of a foreign bank supervised by the 
         Federal Reserve.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref1">Return&nbsp;to&nbsp;text</a></li>

      <li><a name="Footnote3"></a>The Enforcement Section 
         of the Division will continue to be responsible 
         for enforcement actions against the domestic 
         and foreign banking organizations supervised 
         by the Federal Reserve. Both sections continue 
         to report to Herbert&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Biern, Senior 
         Associate Director.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref3">Return&nbsp;to&nbsp;text</a></li>
      <li><a name="Footnote4"></a>It is important to 
         note that Section&nbsp;19 of the Federal Deposit 
         Insurance Act&nbsp;(12&nbsp;U.S.C.&nbsp;1829) 
         currently generally bars a convicted felon 
         from being an officer or director or otherwise 
         participating in the conduct of the affairs 
         of an insured depository institution without 
         the approval of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
         Corporation. Section&nbsp;19 does&nbsp;not 
         cover employment by bank holding companies, 
         nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies, 
         and the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign 
         banks. The use of the suggested language described 
         above is meant to address the limitations of 
         Section&nbsp;19 by mandating that an IAP who 
         is convicted of a criminal offense pursuant 
         to a plea agreement containing this provision 
         cannot work for any domestic or foreign banking 
         organization supervised by the Federal Reserve 
         or any other federal financial institution 
         regulator without the approval of the bank 
         supervisor overseeing the institution where 
         the convicted IAP seeks employment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref4">Return&nbsp;to&nbsp;text</a></li>
      <li><a name="Footnote5"></a>In the event that 
         staff finds that the individual whose misconduct 
         is reported in a SAR is <b>currently</b> employed 
         at a banking organization supervised by the 
         Federal Reserve or any of the other federal 
         financial institutions supervisory agencies, 
         the Reserve Bank must immediately contact the 
         Special Investigations Section. Working together, 
         Board and Reserve Bank staff will coordinate 
         an appropriate response to the situation, which 
         could include the initiation of an immediate 
         suspension action by the Board if the IAP is 
         employed by a Federal Reserve-regulated financial 
         institution. If the IAP is employed at a non-Federal 
         Reserve supervised entity, the matter will 
         be brought to the attention of the bank or 
         functional regulatory authority overseeing 
         the institution currently employing the IAP.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref5">Return&nbsp;to&nbsp;text</a></li>
