<!-- single space -->
<p>The Director of the Division of Banking Supervision 
  and Regulation and the Board's General Counsel, acting 
  under authority delegated by the Board, have approved 
  changes to the System examiners' borrowing rules as 
  a result of the Preserving Independence of Financial 
  Institution Examinations&nbsp;Act of 2003. The Act, 
  among other things, liberalized examiner borrowing 
  restrictions by providing narrow exceptions that enable 
  bank examiners to obtain credit cards and certain 
  home mortgage loans from a broader range of lenders. 
</p>
<p>Under the Act, a Reserve Bank examiner may now accept 
  a credit card or a loan secured by a mortgage on the 
  examiner's principal residence from an institution 
  supervised by the Federal Reserve, as long as the 
  examiner meets the financial requirements to obtain 
  such credit or loan and the terms of the credit or 
  loan are not more favorable than terms generally offered 
  to other borrowers. However, even though an examiner 
  can now obtain such a mortgage, Federal Reserve policy 
  will continue to restrict examiners from examining 
  entities from which they have home mortgage loans.</p>
<p>Changes have been made to the Federal Reserve Administration 
  Manual&nbsp;(FRAM) to reflect the new exceptions (attached). 
  Similar changes will be made in due&nbsp;course to 
  the Reserve Banks' Code of Conduct&nbsp;(Code). Reserve 
  Banks should continue to periodically monitor borrowing 
  relationships to provide adequate oversight over potential 
  conflicts of interest as well as the perception of 
  any conflict of interest. </p>
<p>The Reserve Banks are encouraged to review current 
  examiner files and request that the Board revise &quot;restricted&quot; 
  examiner letters as appropriate. If you have any questions 
  concerning revisions to the policy, please contact 
  Jamie&nbsp;Lenoci, Supervisory Financial Analyst at 
  (202)&nbsp;452-2288.</p>
