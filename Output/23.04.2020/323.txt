 <b><br>
Background</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 309 of the Riegle Community Development and
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (the Act), 12 U.S.C. 4806,
requires the Board (as well as the other Federal banking
agencies) to establish an independent, intra-agency appellate
process that is available to institutions to seek review of
material supervisory determinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 309 specifies
various requirements that the appellate process must meet.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 29, 1994, the Board published for public comment
its proposed guidelines that would implement the intra-agency
appellant process required by section 309 of the Act. (59 Fed. Reg. 67297 (December 29, 1994)).&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the proposed
guidelines required that:&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) all appeals be in writing and
approved by the institution's board of directors; (2) all appeals
be heard and decided within specified timeframes; (3) the initial
appeal be heard by a person or persons selected by the Reserve
Bank (the review panel) who had not participated in, or reported
to the persons who made, the material supervisory determination
under review; (4) an adverse decision by the review panel be
appealable to a Reserve Bank President; (5)&nbsp;an adverse decision
by a Reserve Bank President be appealable to the Board; and (6)
Reserve Banks establish safeguards to protect institutions that
file appeals from examiner retaliation.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although section 309 requires the Board to develop an
internal appeals process only for state member banks, the
proposed guidelines expanded the process and made it available to
all institutions that are subject to Federal Reserve oversight,
including bank holding companies, U.S. agencies and branches of
foreign banks and Edge corporations.<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></a>  The proposed guidelines
also defined a &quot;material supervisory determination&quot; to include
all material matters relating to the examination or inspection
process, but exclude those matters, such as the imposition of a
prompt corrective action directive or a cease and desist order,
for which an alternative, independent right of appeal exists.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted in the proposed guidelines, the Board continues to
believe that questions about or objections to supervisory
determinations made during the course of an inspection or
examination are most effectively handled through the longstanding
Federal Reserve practice of resolving any problems informally
during the course of the inspection or examination process.<br>
<p>
<b><br>Public Comments</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board received 27 comments on its proposed guidelines
from Federal Reserve Banks, financial institutions, trade
associations, law firms and a consulting firm.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the
comments were generally supportive of the proposed guidelines,
most comments submitted suggested changes or raised concerns
regarding the implementation of the internal appeals process.
These proposed changes and concerns, which are discussed below,
relate to five areas:&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) protection from examiner retaliation;
(2) independence of the review panel; (3) who should decide the
final appeal at the Board; (4) the need for additional, specific
timeframes; and (5)&nbsp;procedural issues.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Protection from Examiner Retaliation</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirteen comments raised concerns about examiner
retaliation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several comments suggested that the Ombudsman,
which the Board is required to establish under section 309 of the
Act, should play a role in addressing this issue, such as serving
as an independent contact for institutions that believe they have
been subject to some form of retaliation or ensuring that
different examiners conduct examinations that commence after an
appeal has been filed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some comments suggested that greater
Board involvement in the appeals process would protect
institutions against retaliation, while others suggested that the
guidelines include specific sanctions and disciplinary actions
for examiners found to have engaged in retaliation due to an
appeal.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board acknowledges that some institutions may perceive
that availing themselves of the appeals process may result in
retaliatory action by examiners.&nbsp;&nbsp;As proposed, the guidelines
require the Reserve Banks to establish safeguards to protect
institutions that file appeals from retaliation.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Board
believes that this provides sufficient protection and meets the
requirements of section&nbsp;309, the Ombudsman is available to
address such concerns and may be contacted by institutions who
believe they may have suffered retaliation as a result of an
appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of this official and his/her procedures for
addressing these concerns will be outlined in the Board's Policy
Statement for the Ombudsman.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Independence of Review Panel</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six comments suggested modifications to the part of the
guidelines that addressed the independence of the review panel.
Several stated that the appeals process cannot be independent so
long as it remains an internal procedure and suggested that
outside parties, such as a peer review panel or a panel appointed
by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, hear
and decide all appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another comment suggested that the
review panel exclude not only persons who participated in, or who
directly or indirectly report to the person(s) who participated
in, the material supervisory determination under appeal, but
anyone who directly or indirectly supervises the person(s) who
made such determination.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 309 of the Act reflects a Congressional conclusion
that an intra-agency appeals process will provide institutions
with an adequate means to redress adverse material supervisory
determinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board does not believe that it is necessary
to expand the guidelines beyond what is required by the statute.
Similarly, section 309 requires that the person hearing the
appeal not directly or indirectly report to the person who
initially made the supervisory decision under review.
Consequently, the composition of the review panel has not been
modified in the final guidelines.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Who Decides the Final Appeal at the Board</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed guidelines provided for an appeal of an adverse
decision by a Reserve Bank President to the appropriate Board
division director, who would consult with the appropriate
Governor of the Board's oversight committee for that division.
Three comments suggested that it would be more suitable for a
Governor to review a decision by a Reserve Bank President.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
final guidelines have been modified so that an appeal of a
Reserve Bank President's decision will be to the Governor who
serves as chairman of the appropriate oversight committee, who
will consult with that division's director.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Need for Additional Timeframes</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed guidelines required institutions to file an
appeal within 30 days of the material supervisory determination
and the review panel to decide the appeal within 30 days of its
receipt.&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed guidelines also required Reserve Bank
Presidents to make a decision on any matter appealed to them
within 30 days of receipt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several comments noted that the
proposed guidelines did not contain timeframes for other actions,
such as the time in which an appeal should be filed with a
Reserve Bank President or the Board, or the time in which the
Board would make a decision on an appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board agrees with these comments on the need for
additional timeframes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, the final guidelines
require that an appeal to a Reserve Bank President or the Board
to be filed within 30 days of receipt of an adverse decision by
the review panel or the Reserve Bank President, respectively.
The final guidelines also require that the Board decide any
appeal within 60 days of its receipt.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Procedural Issues</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several comments suggested that the Board's guidelines
include some additional procedures in order to ensure that the
internal appeal process works smoothly.&nbsp;&nbsp;One comment suggested
that the guidelines explicitly provide that the material
supervisory determination remain in effect while it is under
appeal, while another comment suggested that the determination be
stayed pending the completion of the appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board believes
that it is appropriate for the determination to remain in effect
while it is under appeal, and the final guidelines have been
modified to state this explicitly.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board does not believe
that section 309 of the Act is intended to stay the Board's
supervisory decisions, but rather is designed to provide
institutions with a procedure by which to voice objections to
supervisory determinations for which no other formal appeals
procedures exist.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another comment suggested that institutions that consent to
the issuance of a formal enforcement action, such as a cease and
desist order, be allowed to use the internal appeals process to
challenge the material supervisory determinations that led to the
enforcement action.&nbsp;&nbsp;This suggestion seems inconsistent with the
intent of section&nbsp;309 of the Act, which is to provide an avenue
for the review of material supervisory determinations and not to
contest enforcement actions for which an alterative appeals
mechanism exists.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Board has not adopted this
suggestion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another comment suggested that the record be
expunged of any material supervisory decisions that have been
modified or overturned on appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board believes that it is
appropriate to maintain all records of its supervisory actions,
including those relating to a decision that is modified or
overturned as a result of an internal appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, the
Reserve Banks are expected to maintain complete records of any
appeal, including updating all files, both hard copy and
electronic, to reflect the results of all appeals.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One comment suggested that the board of directors of an
institution only be required to approve the initiation of an
appeal, but that management be allowed to decide on any
subsequent appeals to a Reserve Bank President or the Board.
Another comment noted that getting approval of the board of
directors of a foreign bank would be extremely difficult in order
for its U.S. agency or branch to file timely appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board
continues to believe that the board of directors should be
involved in each step of the appeals process; therefore, the
final guidelines still require board approval for each step in
the appeals process.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the final guidelines
have been modified to allow the senior management person(s) with
authority for U.S. operations of a foreign bank to approve
appeals; however, he or she must approve each step of the appeal.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has decided to adopt several other procedural
suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The final guidelines provide that any appeal filed
must contain all of the facts and arguments that the institution
would like to present to the review panel, the Reserve Bank
President or the Board, as the case may be, and that the review
panel, the Reserve Bank President or the Board may reject the
appeal for lack of clarity or information.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a case, an
institution would have 30 days in which to refile a rejected
appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, the final guidelines make explicit that the
internal appeals process does not give the appealing institutions
any discovery or other similar rights.<br>
<p>
 <b>
GUIDELINES FOR APPEALS OF MATERIAL SUPERVISORY DETERMINATIONS</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 309 of the Riegle Community Development and
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, 12 U.S.C. 4806, requires the
Board and the other Federal banking agencies to establish an
independent, intra-agency process to review appeals of material
supervisory determinations.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of these guidelines is to allow each Reserve
Bank to administer its own appellate process, but to establish
procedures under which all Reserve Banks' appellate process must
operate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing so will ensure that each Reserve Bank's process
is consistent with section 309 and that institutions will be
granted the same appellant rights regardless of the Federal
Reserve district in which they reside.<br>
<br>
<b>Procedures for Appealing a Material Supervisory Determination</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any appeal of a material supervisory determination pursuant
to section 309 shall be filed and considered pursuant to the
following procedures.<br>
<p>
(1) Any appeal shall be approved by the board of directors of the
institution, or in the case of a U.S. agency or branch of a
foreign bank, the senior management person(s) responsible for the
bank's U.S. operations, and filed in writing with the Secretary
of the Reserve Bank or other appropriate Reserve Bank official
within 30 calendar days of receipt of the written material
supervisory determination, unless the time for filing is extended
by the Reserve Bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reserve Bank shall promptly provide a
copy of the appeal to the appropriate division director of the
staff of the Board of Governors.<br>
<p>
(2) Any appeal shall contain all the facts and arguments that the
institution wishes to present.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal may be rejected for
lack of clarity or information.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such case, the institution
may refile the appeal within 30 calendar days of receipt of
written notice of the rejection of any filing.<br>
<p>
(3) The appeal shall be considered in the first instance by a
person or persons selected by the Reserve Bank (the review panel)
who --<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) did not participate in the material supervisory
determination;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) do not directly or indirectly report to the person who
made the material supervisory determination under review; and<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) are qualified to review the material supervisory
determination.<br>
<p>
(4) The appellant institution may appear before the review panel
in order to present testimony and, with the consent of the review
panel, witnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;The review panel shall also solicit the views of the Reserve Bank staff involved in the determination under
appeal, Board staff, and, where appropriate, the staff of other
supervisory agencies (for example, in case of joint examinations
or inspections).&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this appeals process shall create
any discovery or other such rights.<br>
<p>
(5) Any appeal shall be decided, in writing, by the review panel
within 30 calendar days of the filing of an informationally
complete appeal, unless the appellant and the review panel
jointly agree to extend the time for decision.<br>
<p>

<p>
(6) Any appellant institution dissatisfied with the decision of
the review panel may, with the consent of its board of directors
of the institution, or in the case of a U.S. agency or branch of
a foreign bank, the senior management person(s) responsible for
the bank's U.S. operations, appeal that decision to the Reserve
Bank President by filing a written appeal with the Secretary of
the Reserve Bank or other appropriate Reserve Bank official
within 30 calendar days of receipt of the review panel's written
decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal shall contain all facts and arguments that
the institution wishes to be considered.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal may be
rejected for lack of clarity or information.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such case, the
institution may refile the appeal within 30 calendar days of
receipt of written notice of the rejection.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal shall be
decided by the Reserve Bank President, in writing, within 30
calendar days of the filing of an informationally complete
appeal.<br>
<p>
(7) Any appellant institution dissatisfied with the decision of
the Reserve Bank President may, with the consent of its board of
directors of the institution, or in the case of a U.S. agency or
branch of a foreign bank, the senior management person(s)
responsible for the bank's U.S. operations, appeal that decision
to the appropriate Governor by filing a written appeal with the
Secretary of the Board within 30 calendar days of receipt of the
Reserve Bank President's written decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal may be
rejected for lack of clarity or information.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such case, the
institution may refile the appeal within 30 calendar days of
receipt of written notice of the rejection.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal shall be
decided, in writing, by the appropriate Governor, who shall
consult with the director of the appropriate division of the
Board of Governors, within 60 calendar days of the filing of an
informationally complete appeal. <br>

<p>
<br>
<b>Safeguards Against Retaliation</b>. Each Reserve Bank shall establish
appropriate safeguards to protect appellants from retaliation.
The Board's Ombudsman will periodically contact institutions
after their appeals have been decided in order to make certain
that no retaliation has occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, institutions who
believe they have suffered retaliation as the result of an appeal
may contact the Board's Ombudsman.<br>
<br>
<b>Availability of Procedures</b>. Each Reserve Bank shall make these
guidelines and the Reserve Bank's process for selecting a review
panel available to each institution in its district, any
institution appealing a material supervisory determination, and
any member of the public who requests them.<br>
<br>
<b>Eligible Institutions</b>. Any institution about which the Federal
Reserve makes a material supervisory determination is eligible
for the appeal process.&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes state member banks, bank
holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries, U.S. agencies
and branches of foreign banks, Edge and agreement corporations,
third party EDP servicers, and other entities examined or
inspected by a Reserve Bank.<br>
<br>
<b>Material Supervisory Determination Defined</b>. Whether an appealed
action constitutes a &quot;material supervisory determination&quot;
eligible for the appeals process shall be decided by the person
or persons hearing the appeal, and a determination that the
action is not appealable under these guidelines may be further
appealed to the Reserve Bank President or the appropriate
oversight Governor in the same manner as any other adverse
decision.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The term &quot;material supervisory determination&quot; includes, but
is not limited to, material determinations relating to
examination or inspection composite ratings, the adequacy of loan
loss reserves and significant loan classifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;The term does <i>not </i>include any supervisory determination for which an independent right of appeal exists.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such actions include prompt corrective action directives issued pursuant to section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the FDI Act), actions
to impose administrative enforcement actions under the FDI Act
and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC
Act), capital directives, and orders issued pursuant to
applications under the BHC Act.<br>
<br>
<b>Effect of Appeal on Material Supervisory Determinations</b>. A
material supervisory determination shall remain in effect while
under appeal and until such time it is modified or overturned
through the appeals process.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal of a material
supervisory determination does not prevent the Federal Reserve
from taking any supervisory or enforcement action -- formal or
informal -- it deems appropriate to discharge the Federal
Reserve's supervisory responsibilities. <br>
<br>
<b>Savings Provision</b>. Section 309 expressly provides that it shall
not affect the authority of the Board or any other agency to take
enforcement or supervisory action against an institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
such cases, the rights of appeal provided for in the statutes and
regulations concerning these actions shall govern.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, March 24, 1995.<br>
