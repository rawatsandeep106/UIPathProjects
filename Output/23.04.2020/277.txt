&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Government Securities Act of 1986, the
Federal Reserve System is assigned responsibility for
supervising the government securities dealer or government
securities broker operations of a state branch or state
agency of a foreign bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same supervisory
responsibility is mandated for examination for compliance
with Title II of the Act which applies to any depository
institution, including state branches and agencies of foreign
banks, that holds government securities for customers as
fiduciary, custodian or otherwise.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  All State branches or state agencies of foreign
banks that conduct government securities dealer or government
securities broker operations are required to file notices of
such activities with the Federal Reserve unless they meet
certain conditional exceptions contained in the Treasury
Department regulations. (17 CFR Ch. IV, Sec. 400, et seq.) In
particular, a branch or agency is not required to file if all
the customers with or on behalf of whom it engages in
government securities transactions are foreign governments,
agencies, corporations or persons who reside or have their
principal place of business outside the U.S. (17 CFR 401.6).
It is likely that most branches and agencies may confine
their activities in this regard to non-citizens who are non-residents of the United States.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, a branch or agency,
like any other depository institution, would not be required
to file solely because it enters into repurchase transactions
with customers (17 CFR 401.4(a)(2)).&nbsp;&nbsp;These exemptions are
conditioned in both instances upon the branch or agency
complying with Part 450 of the Treasury Department
regulations concerning custodial holdings of government
securities.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One uninsured state agency and three uninsured
branches of foreign banks have filed notices with the Board
that they are government securities brokers or dealers.&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is not known how many other state branches or agencies,
insured or uninsured, are engaged in activities that would
require them to file as a government securities broker or
dealer, except for the conditional exceptions noted above.
In any case, it seems probable that many branches or agencies
of foreign banks may be required to comply with Part 450 of
the Treasury Department regulations, either because of the
conditional exemptions or because they may otherwise hold
government securities for customers.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to discharge the Federal Reserve's
responsibilities under the Government Securities Act, the
following agreements and procedures have been developed:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Insured Branches.
<p>
Since the FDIC has responsibility for the general
supervision and examination of insured branches of foreign
banks, we have reached an agreement with the FDIC to conduct
joint examinations of the government securities dealer or
broker operations of an insured branch of a foreign bank that
has notified us that it is a government securities dealer or
broker.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the FDIC has agreed that it would review
all other insured branches for compliance with Treasury
Department regulations under the Government Securities Act
during the course of its regular examination.&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIC has
agreed to notify us of any potential violations of the
Government Securities Act regulations that may warrant
supervisory action.
<p>
<li>Uninsured Branches.
<p>
It will be expected that whenever a Reserve Bank
conducts an examination of an uninsured branch or agency of a
foreign bank for compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, it
will, at the same time, examine for compliance with the
Government Securities Act regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar to the
procedures set forth in SR 88-13(IB) (May 6, 1988), a Reserve
Bank can rely on examinations conducted by State regulatory
authorities, provided the State regulatory authority agrees
to notify us of any potential violations that may warrant
supervisory action.
</ol>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examination procedures relating to government
securities activities were enclosed with SR 87-37 (SA), dated
November 6, 1987.&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I of those examination procedures
contains a list of preliminary questions designed to provide
information concerning the nature and scope of government
securities activities performed by the institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
responses to these questions should enable the examiner to
determine which of the examination procedures and checklists
to use in further checking for compliance.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have any questions concerning this matter,
please call Susan Meyers or Mike Schoenfeld, ((202)452-2781)
or me ((202)452-2782).
