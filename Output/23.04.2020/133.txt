<div class="salutation">TO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE OF SUPERVISION AND APPROPRIATE 
   SUPERVISORY AND EXAMINATION STAFF AT EACH FEDERAL RESERVE BANK</div>				
<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsible Reserve Bank and Inter-District Coordination</div>
<p>The evolution of the banking industry, including its continued consolidation, 
   underscores the critical importance of effective inter-district coordination 
   among the Reserve Banks. The Federal Reserve has had longstanding supervisory 
   guidance addressing coordination of supervisory activities among the Reserve 
   Banks. For banking organizations that operate in more than one district, it 
   is particularly important that all relevant and significant supervisory findings 
   are assessed and weighed in evaluating the consolidated banking organization 
   and that a consistent and coordinated supervisory message is communicated 
   to the organization. To achieve this objective, the System has long operated 
   under the principle that there is one responsible Reserve Bank for each fully 
   consolidated banking organization (i.e.,&nbsp;each top-tier consolidated banking 
   organization). This letter identifies the responsible Reserve Bank for a banking 
   organization, highlights the role of the responsible Reserve Bank in inter-district 
   coordination of banking supervision, and clarifies the roles and duties of 
   the responsible and local Reserve Banks in conducting inter-district inspections 
   and examinations.<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a> </p>
<p>The responsible Reserve Bank is accountable for all aspects of supervision 
   of the fully consolidated banking organization, including all subsidiaries 
   and affiliates (domestic, foreign, and Edge corporations) of the organization 
   for which the Federal Reserve has supervisory oversight responsibility. The 
   responsible Reserve Bank is generally expected to work with local Reserve 
   Banks in conducting examinations and other supervisory activities, particularly 
   where significant banking operations are conducted in a local district. Thus, 
   for state member banks, the local Reserve Bank will continue to have an important 
   role in the supervision of that subsidiary. However, the responsible Reserve 
   Bank retains authority and accountability for the results of all examinations 
   and reviews performed on its behalf.<a href="#Footnote2" name="Footref2" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a> </p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Defining the Responsible Reserve Bank for Supervisory 
   Purposes</div>
<p>The responsible Reserve Bank for a banking organization generally has been 
   the Reserve Bank in the district where the banking operations of the organization 
   are principally conducted. Under this SR&nbsp;letter, for domestic banking 
   organizations the responsible Reserve Bank typically will be the district 
   where the head office of the top tier organization is located and its overall 
   strategic direction is established and overseen. For foreign banking organizations, 
   the responsible Reserve Bank typically will be the district where the Federal 
   Reserve has the most direct involvement in the conduct of day-to-day supervision 
   of the U.S. banking operations of the organization.</p>
<p>Where necessary, the Board's Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation&nbsp;(BS&amp;R) 
   in consultation with the Division of Consumer and Community Affairs&nbsp;(C&amp;CA) 
   may designate a responsible Reserve Bank when the general principles set forth 
   above could impede the ability of the Federal Reserve to perform its functions 
   under law, do not result in an efficient allocation of supervisory resources, 
   or are otherwise not appropriate. Board staff will work with Reserve Bank 
   staff to resolve specific instances where more than one Reserve Bank is currently 
   sharing supervisory responsibilities for a consolidated banking organization.</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Responsible Reserve Bank Duties</div>
<p>The responsible Reserve Bank develops the consolidated risk assessment and 
   supervisory plan and ensures that the scope and timing of planned activities 
   among participating districts and agencies pursuant to the plan are appropriate 
   given the consolidated risk assessment. The responsible Reserve Bank designates 
   the central point of contact or lead examiner and ensures that all safety 
   and soundness, information technology, trust, consumer compliance, Community 
   Reinvestment Act&nbsp;(CRA), and other specialty examinations, inspections, 
   and visitations are conducted and appropriately coordinated within the System 
   and with other regulators. In addition, the responsible Reserve Bank manages 
   all formal communications with the foreign and domestic supervised entity, 
   including those involving supervisory assessments, ratings and remedial actions.<a href="#Footnote3" name="Footref3" title="Footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Sharing of Responsible Reserve Bank Duties</div>
<p>A responsible Reserve Bank is encouraged to arrange for the local Reserve 
   Bank to undertake on its behalf certain examinations or other supervisory 
   activities to take advantage of opportunities to enhance supervisory effectiveness 
   or efficiency. For example, use of the local district may reduce costs and 
   can facilitate communication by leveraging existing relationships with local 
   representatives of the organization or local supervisors. Additionally, local 
   Reserve Banks may provide specialty examination resources, such as in the 
   case of CRA examinations where local Reserve Bank staff often provide valuable 
   insights into local communities and lending institutions that should be factored 
   into the CRA assessment. When other districts conduct examinations and other 
   supervisory activities for the responsible Reserve Bank, substantial reliance 
   should be placed on the conclusions and ratings recommended by the participating 
   Reserve Bank(s). </p>
<p>The responsible Reserve Bank retains authority and accountability for the 
   results of all examinations and reviews performed on its behalf, and, therefore 
   must work closely with local Reserve Bank examination teams to ensure that 
   examination scopes and conclusions are consistent with the supervisory approach 
   and message applied across the consolidated organization. Where a local Reserve 
   Bank is directly conducting supervisory activities on behalf of the responsible 
   Reserve Bank and it identifies major issues, those issues should be brought 
   to the attention of the responsible Reserve Bank in a timely manner.</p>
<p>If a responsible Reserve Bank arranges for a local Reserve Bank to conduct 
   supervisory activities on its behalf, the local Reserve Bank is responsible 
   for the costs of performing the activities. If the local Reserve Bank is unable 
   to fulfill the request from the responsible Reserve Bank to perform the specified 
   activities, the responsible Reserve Bank should seek System assistance, if 
   needed, by contacting Board staff or through other established resource coordination 
   mechanisms.</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Regulatory Reports and Applications</div>
<p>The responsible Reserve Bank generally is charged with the collection and 
   review of regulatory reports. However, if other arrangements are more practicable 
   or consistent with long-standing practice, and if changing these arrangements 
   would create inefficiencies or would result in increased regulatory burden, 
   the responsible Reserve Bank may continue to use them. Thus, it is not envisioned 
   that banking organizations would need to change the location where they currently 
   file regulatory reports. Alternative arrangements should be clearly documented 
   in writing by senior management at the affected Reserve Banks. </p>
<p>Application responsibilities are currently specified in Regulations&nbsp;Y,&nbsp;K, 
   and&nbsp;H&nbsp;(12&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;225.3(b), 12&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;211.21(c), and 
   12&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;208.3(a)). </p>
<p>Questions regarding this letter should be directed to the appropriate officer 
   in the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation or the Division of Consumer 
   and Community Affairs. </p>
