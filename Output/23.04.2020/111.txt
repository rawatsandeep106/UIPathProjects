<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Adoption of 
   Regulation&nbsp;W Implementing Sections&nbsp;23A 
   and&nbsp;23B of the Federal Reserve Act</div>
<p>On December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2002, Regulation&nbsp;W, 
   the rule that comprehensively implements sections&nbsp;23A 
   and&nbsp;23B of the Federal&nbsp;Reserve&nbsp;Act, 
   was published in the <i>Federal&nbsp;Register</i>.<a href="#Footnote1" 
   name="Footref1"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp; The rule is 
   effective April&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2003.</p>
<p>Sections&nbsp;23A 
   and&nbsp;23B and Regulation&nbsp;W limit the risks 
   to a bank from transactions between the bank and 
   its affiliates and limit the ability of a bank to 
   transfer to its affiliates the subsidy arising from 
   the bank's access to the Federal safety net (i.e.,&nbsp;lower 
   cost insured deposits, the payment system, and the 
   discount window).<a href="#Footnote2" 
   name="Footref2"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp; The statute 
   and rule accomplish these purposes by imposing quantitative 
   and qualitative limits on the ability of a bank to 
   extend credit to, or engage in certain other transactions 
   with, an affiliate.&nbsp; Transactions between a 
   bank and a nonaffiliate that benefit an affiliate 
   of the bank are covered by the statute and regulation 
   as well, through the well-established &quot;attribution&quot; 
   principle.&nbsp; However, certain transactions that 
   generally do not expose a bank to undue risk or abuse 
   the safety net are exempted from coverage under Regulation&nbsp;W.</p>
<p>The 
   Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act&nbsp;(GLBA) increased the 
   range of affiliations permitted to banking organizations.&nbsp; 
   A key&nbsp;premise of GLBA was that sections&nbsp;23A 
   and&nbsp;23B would limit the risk to depository institutions 
   from these broader affiliations and eliminate the 
   need for extensive prior review by the bank regulatory 
   agencies.&nbsp; Given the enhanced role of sections&nbsp;23A 
   and&nbsp;23B in risk management after GLBA, it is 
   essential that examiners and other supervisory staff 
   review intercompany transactions for compliance with 
   the statutes and Regulation&nbsp;W.&nbsp; Reviews 
   for compliance with the affiliate transaction rules 
   should be frequent and rigorous, and any violations 
   or potential violations should be resolved quickly.</p>
<p>A summary of significant issues addressed in the 
   rule follows.&nbsp; The attached appendix provides 
   a comprehensive review of the rule. </p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Significant Issues Addressed in Regulation&nbsp;W</div>
<p>Regulation&nbsp;W 
   includes 70&nbsp;years' worth of interpretive guidance 
   furnished by the Board and its staff concerning statutory 
   requirements that are fairly brief, but extremely 
   complex in application.&nbsp; The following summarizes 
   how the Board resolved nine significant issues addressed 
   by the final rule.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; 
   <u>Derivatives</u>.&nbsp; The final rule (i)&nbsp;provides 
   that derivative transactions between banks and their 
   affiliates are subject to the market terms requirement 
   of section&nbsp;23B, and (ii)&nbsp;requires banks 
   to adopt policies and procedures to manage the credit 
   exposure arising from their derivative transactions 
   with affiliates.&nbsp; The final rule does not subject 
   credit exposure arising from bank-affiliate derivatives 
   to the quantitative limits and collateral requirements 
   of section&nbsp;23A.&nbsp; The final rule also provides 
   that credit derivatives between a bank and a nonaffiliate 
   in which the bank protects the nonaffiliate from 
   a default on, or decline in value of, an obligation 
   of an affiliate of the bank are covered transactions 
   under section&nbsp;23A.</p>
<p>In 
   the near future, the Board expects to issue a proposed 
   rule that would seek public comment on how, under 
   section&nbsp;23A, to treat derivative transactions 
   that are the functional equivalent of a loan by a 
   bank to an affiliate or the functional equivalent 
   of an asset purchase by a bank from an affiliate. 
<p>2.&nbsp; 
   <u>Intraday Credit</u>.&nbsp; The final rule (i)&nbsp;provides 
   that intraday extensions of credit by a bank to an 
   affiliate are subject to the market terms requirement 
   of section&nbsp;23B, and (ii)&nbsp;exempts intraday 
   credit extensions by a bank to an affiliate from 
   the quantitative limits and collateral requirements 
   of section&nbsp;23A if the bank adopts policies and 
   procedures to manage the credit exposure arising 
   from its intraday credit extensions to affiliates 
   and has no reason to believe that the affiliate would 
   have difficulty repaying the credit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; 
   <u>Financial Subsidiaries</u>.&nbsp; The final rule 
   provides that financial subsidiaries of a bank are 
   affiliates of the bank.&nbsp; Thus, under the final 
   rule, transactions between a bank and its financial 
   subsidiary, as well as other affiliates, are subject 
   to the requirements of sections&nbsp;23A and 23B.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 
   addition to transactions between a bank and its financial 
   subsidiary, certain transactions between an affiliate 
   of a bank and a financial subsidiary of the bank 
   are subject to sections&nbsp;23A and&nbsp;23B.&nbsp; 
   Any purchase of, or investment in, the securities 
   of a financial subsidiary of a bank by an affiliate 
   of the bank is treated as a purchase of, or investment 
   in, such securities by the bank.&nbsp; An extension 
   of credit to a financial subsidiary of a bank by 
   an affiliate of the bank is treated as an extension 
   of credit by the bank if the extension of credit 
   is treated as regulatory capital of the financial 
   subsidiary.&nbsp; Other extensions of credit to a 
   financial subsidiary of a bank by an affiliate of 
   the bank may be treated as an extension of credit 
   by the bank to the financial subsidiary if the Board 
   determines, on a case-by-case basis, that such treatment 
   is necessary or appropriate to prevent evasions of 
   the Federal&nbsp;Reserve&nbsp;Act or GLBA. </p>
<p>The 
   final rule, consistent with the law, defines a financial 
   subsidiary as any subsidiary of a national or state 
   chartered bank that engages in an activity not permissible 
   for <u>national</u> banks to conduct directly.&nbsp; 
   The final rule, however, exempts insurance agency 
   subsidiaries of national and state chartered banks 
   from the definition of financial subsidiary because 
   these subsidiaries usually require little funding 
   from their parent bank and generally do not pose 
   a substantial threat to bank safety and soundness.&nbsp; 
   In addition, the final rule exempts subsidiaries 
   of a <u>state</u> chartered bank that engage only 
   in (i)&nbsp;activities permissible for the <u>state</u> 
   chartered bank to conduct directly, or (ii)&nbsp;activities 
   they were lawfully conducting before issuance of 
   the final rule (a grandfather provision for existing 
   subsidiaries).</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; 
   <u>General Purpose Credit Card Exemption</u>.&nbsp; 
   The final rule exempts from section&nbsp;23A extensions 
   of credit by a bank under a general purpose credit 
   card where the borrower uses the credit to purchase 
   goods or services from an affiliate of the bank.&nbsp; 
   The final rule defines a general purpose credit card 
   as a credit card issued by a bank that is widely 
   accepted by merchants (such as a Visa card or Mastercard) 
   so long as less than 25&nbsp;percent of the aggregate 
   amount of purchases with the card are purchases from 
   an affiliate of the bank. </p>
<p>The 
   final rule generally exempts from the 25&nbsp;percent 
   test any bank that does not have nonfinancial affiliates, 
   because banks with retail commercial affiliates typically 
   are the banks whose credit cards are used substantially 
   to purchase goods or services from affiliates of 
   the banks.&nbsp; The final rule also exempts from 
   the 25&nbsp;percent test any widely accepted credit 
   card if the issuer bank can establish to the Board's 
   satisfaction that a minimal percentage of purchases 
   with the card would be purchases from an affiliate 
   of the bank. </p>
<p>5.&nbsp; 
   <u>Foreign Banks</u>.&nbsp; For competitive equity 
   reasons, the final rule applies sections&nbsp;23A 
   and&nbsp;23B to transactions between the U.S.&nbsp;branches 
   and agencies of a foreign bank and affiliates of 
   the foreign bank engaged in the United&nbsp;States 
   in several new GLBA activities, including securities 
   underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting, 
   merchant banking, and insurance company investment.&nbsp; 
   The regulation does <u>not</u> apply sections&nbsp;23A 
   or&nbsp;23B to transactions between a U.S.&nbsp;branch 
   or agency of a foreign bank and any other type of 
   affiliate (for example, foreign affiliates or U.S. 
   affiliates engaged in pre-GLBA nonbanking activities), 
   or to transactions between the foreign bank's non-U.S. 
   offices and its U.S. nonbank affiliates.&nbsp; This 
   approach is consistent with the Board's previous 
   application of sections&nbsp;23A and&nbsp;23B to 
   section&nbsp;20 affiliates of foreign banks before 
   GLBA and securities and merchant banking affiliates 
   of foreign banks after GLBA.&nbsp; Of course, sections&nbsp;23A 
   and&nbsp;23B and Regulation&nbsp;W apply to a U.S.&nbsp;<i>bank</i> 
   subsidiary of a foreign bank in the same manner and 
   to the same extent as they would apply to any other 
   U.S.&nbsp;bank. </p>
<p>6.&nbsp; 
   <u>Section&nbsp;250.250 Exemption</u>.&nbsp; Since&nbsp;1974, 
   a bank's purchase of loans from an affiliate has 
   not been subject to section&nbsp;23A if (i)&nbsp;the 
   bank makes an independent evaluation of the creditworthiness 
   of the borrower before the affiliate makes the loan, 
   and (ii)&nbsp;the bank commits to purchase the loan 
   prior to the affiliate making the loan (the &quot;250.250&nbsp;exemption&quot;).&nbsp; 
   The purpose of the exemption was to allow a bank 
   to take advantage of an investment opportunity and 
   not to alleviate the funding needs of an affiliate.&nbsp; 
   By the 1990s, however, some banks were using this 
   exemption to provide nearly all their non-bank lending 
   affiliates' funding.&nbsp; In&nbsp;1995, to ensure 
   that banks used the 250.250&nbsp;exemption consistently 
   with its original purpose, Board staff opined that 
   the exemption was not available to any bank whose 
   loan purchases from an affiliate represented more 
   than 50&nbsp;percent of the loans made by the affiliate.</p>
<p>The 
   final rule retains the 50&nbsp;percent test as a 
   general matter but allows the bank's primary federal 
   regulator to reduce the 50&nbsp;percent threshold 
   prospectively, on a case-by-case basis, if appropriate 
   to protect the safety and soundness of the bank.&nbsp; 
   Concurrent with the adoption of the final Regulation&nbsp;W, 
   the Board is seeking comment on a proposed rule that 
   would limit a bank's purchases of extensions of credit 
   from an affiliate under the exemption to 100&nbsp;percent 
   of the bank's capital stock and surplus.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; 
   <u>Affiliated mutual funds</u>.&nbsp; The final rule 
   includes an exemption for loans by a bank to a third&nbsp;party 
   secured by securities issued by a mutual fund affiliate 
   of the bank (subject to a number of conditions). 
</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; 
   <u>Corporate reorganizations</u>.&nbsp; The final 
   rule contains an exemption that would permit a banking 
   organization to engage more expeditiously in internal 
   reorganization transactions involving a bank's purchase 
   of assets from an affiliate (subject to a number 
   of conditions, including those that the Board traditionally 
   has imposed when granting case-by-case exemptions 
   for such transactions). </p>
<p>9.&nbsp; 
   <u>Valuation rules</u>.&nbsp; The final rule contains 
   new valuation rules for a bank's investments in, 
   and acquisitions of, affiliates. </p>
