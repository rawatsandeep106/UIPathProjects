<div class="salutation">TO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE OF 
  SUPERVISION<br>
  AT EACH FEDERAL RESERVE BANK</div>				
<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Revised Policy Governing Access to Confidential 
   Supervisory Information</div>
<p>On August 7, 2006, by an immediately effective interim rule, the Board amended 
   its rule regarding the employment of non-citizens to permit the hiring of 
   certain non-citizens into positions requiring access to confidential supervisory 
   information, subject to certain conditions. Although the rule focuses on the 
   hiring of Board staff, it affects Reserve Bank staff needing access to Board 
   information in performing activities on behalf of the Board. The interim rule 
   clarifies that Reserve Bank staff who seek access to confidential supervisory 
   information must meet the same conditions that apply to Board staff. The interim 
   rule retains the Board's preference for employing U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals 
   over equally qualified persons who are not U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals. 
   The interim rule parallels a recently implemented restriction that the Federal 
   Open Market Committee&nbsp;(FOMC) applies to access by Reserve Bank employees 
   to FOMC information. The full text of the Federal Register notice is attached 
   (Attachment&nbsp;1). </p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Rule Governing Access to Confidential Supervisory 
   Information</div>
<p>Confidential supervisory information generally consists of information regarding 
   the Board's examination and supervision of entities subject to its jurisdiction. 
   Under the August&nbsp;7,&nbsp;2006, interim rule (as was the case under the 
   prior interim rule covering FOMC information),<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
   access to confidential supervisory information is limited to &quot;Protected 
   Individuals,&quot; which covers three categories of persons: U.S. citizens, 
   U.S. nationals, and non-citizens (i.e.,&nbsp;lawful permanent resident aliens 
   or &quot;green card holders&quot;) who are eligible for U.S. citizenship and 
   seeking such citizenship.<a href="#Footnote2" name="Footref2" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
   In addition, under the new interim rule, a non-citizen in a position requiring 
   a Ph.D. in economics or finance who meets certain conditions is also eligible 
   for access to confidential supervisory information, as further described below. 
</p>
<p>These requirements extend to all supervisory staff requiring access to confidential 
   supervisory information, including but not limited to Federal Reserve examiners, 
   as well as other Reserve Bank employees who are authorized to access confidential 
   supervisory information. The requirements apply to confidential supervisory 
   information at any level (i.e.,&nbsp;Restricted-Controlled&nbsp;FR, Restricted&nbsp;FR, 
   and Internal&nbsp;FR), in any form (e.g.,&nbsp;paper or electronic) and irrespective 
   of where the information resides in the Federal Reserve System, including 
   both national and local databases. Thus, unless an employee is a Protected 
   Individual or qualifies for the limited exception for certain non-citizens 
   described below, the employee may not have access to confidential supervisory 
   information.</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Exception for Non-citizen<a href="#Footnote3" name="Footref3" title="Footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
   Access to Confidential Supervisory Information</div>
<p>The immediately effective interim rule provides a narrow exception for certain 
   non-citizens with valid work visas hired into certain positions (which the 
   interim rule refers to as an &quot;Eligible Position&quot;). The change was 
   prompted by a specific business need to hire qualified individuals with a 
   Ph.D. in economics or finance to perform risk quantification analysis required 
   by evolving risk management practices and expected revisions to capital guidelines 
   and frameworks (i.e., Basel II). The exception is a narrow one, as the only 
   Eligible Positions are those that require a Ph.D. in economics or in finance 
   and require access to confidential supervisory information. The exception 
   does not extend, for example, to Federal Reserve examiners or supervision 
   staff in other job functions that require access to confidential supervisory 
   information. A non-citizen employed in an Eligible Position will be permitted, 
   however, to receive a temporary credential authorizing his or her participation 
   in an examination or inspection as a subject matter expert. </p>
<p>For a non-citizen with a valid work visa employed in an Eligible Position, 
   access to confidential supervisory information and the level of access that 
   the non-citizen is eligible to receive are contingent on the non-citizen meeting 
   certain Country List, employment, and residency requirements. In addition, 
   the Director of the Board's Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation 
   must concur with a Reserve Bank's recommendation to provide a non-citizen 
   in an Eligible Position access to confidential supervisory information as 
   a condition for allowing access and a background investigation satisfactory 
   to the Board may be required.<a href="#Footnote4" name="Footref4" title="Footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a> The rule distinguishes between non-citizens 
   from a country on the Country List, which is contained in the annual federal 
   appropriations' laws, and those non-citizens who are from a country that is 
   not on the Country List. While the Board, whose funds are not appropriated, 
   is not subject to the limitations specifying the countries whose citizens 
   are eligible to be hired as federal employees using appropriated funds, the 
   interim rule uses the Country List as a common point of reference to help 
   align the Board's practices with those approved by Congress in appropriating 
   funds to federal government agencies. This will help ensure consistent treatment 
   for all System employees engaged in supervisory activities, which are conducted 
   by the Reserve Banks under delegated authority by the Board. </p>
<p>Attachment 2 contains a table that summarizes the information access policy 
   by category of staff and security level, including the new exception for non-citizens 
   with valid work visas employed in Eligible Positions. Under the new interim 
   rule, a non-citizen with a valid work visa who is from a country on the Country 
   List, and who is employed in an Eligible Position, may receive access to confidential 
   supervisory information classified as Internal&nbsp;FR or Restricted&nbsp;FR. 
   A non-citizen in this category would be eligible for access to the most sensitive 
   information, Restricted-Controlled&nbsp;FR information, only after meeting 
   the following conditions: (1)&nbsp;the Reserve Bank officer-in-charge of supervision 
   has recommended the employee for access to Restricted-Controlled information 
   and the Board's Director of Banking Supervision and Regulation has concurred 
   with the recommendation; (2)&nbsp;the employee has resided in the United States 
   for at least six&nbsp;years and has been employed for at least two&nbsp;years 
   in the Federal Reserve System; and (3)&nbsp;the employee has passed a background 
   investigation acceptable to the Board. A non-citizen with a valid work visa 
   who is from a country <i>not</i> on the Country List, and who is employed 
   in an Eligible Position, may be granted access to Internal&nbsp;FR information 
   without having to meet the length of employment or U.S. residency requirements. 
   Further, a non-citizen in this category would be eligible to receive access 
   to Restricted&nbsp;FR information if he or she meets the same three conditions 
   noted above. Such a non-citizen, however, would <i>not</i> be eligible for 
   access to Restricted-Controlled information under the interim rule. </p>
<p>Attachment 3 contains the current Country List used by federal government 
   agencies, which is the common point of reference for applying the interim 
   rule. If the employee's country is deleted from the Country List after the 
   employee begins his or her employment with the Federal Reserve System, the 
   employee's existing access to confidential supervisory information designated 
   as Restricted&nbsp;FR or Restricted-Controlled&nbsp;FR will not be affected by the change 
   in the Country List. Similarly, the employee would continue to be eligible 
   for access to confidential supervisory information classified Restricted-Controlled&nbsp;FR information and may be granted such access if he or she meets the additional 
   conditions outlined below for employees from a country on the Country List.</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Grandfathering Provisions</div>
<p>For some Reserve Banks, these requirements may represent a change from past 
   Reserve Bank practice. Accordingly, a small number of Reserve Bank staff who 
   had access to confidential supervisory information as of August&nbsp;7,&nbsp;2006, 
   the effective date of the interim rule, who now would not qualify for such 
   access or need to take additional steps to be granted access, may continue 
   their existing level of access subject to the successful completion of a background 
   check. This means, for example, that a non-citizen Reserve Bank employee who 
   is not from a country on the Country List and who currently has access to 
   Restricted&nbsp;FR information, will continue to have access to this information, 
   but will be subject to successful completion of a background check. As a non-citizen 
   from a country not on the Country List, this employee would remain ineligible 
   for access to Restricted-Controlled&nbsp;FR information. As previously noted, 
   background checks will be performed by the Board on behalf of Reserve Banks 
   following current procedures.</p>
<p>The interim rule does permit a lawful permanent resident alien who was a System 
   employee as of January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2006, who does not currently have access 
   to confidential supervisory information and who does not qualify as a Protected 
   Individual because he or she failed to file for citizenship within six months 
   of eligibility, to become a Protected Individual if he or she meets the requirements 
   of the interim rule and undergoes a background check acceptable to the Board. 
   The interim rule permits this employee to become a Protected Individual if, 
   before requesting access to confidential supervisory information, he or she 
   files for citizenship. To retain access to confidential supervisory information 
   under this grandfathering provision, the employee must attain U.S. citizenship 
   within two&nbsp;years of applying for it, not counting the processing time 
   by the Department of Homeland Security, Citizenship and Immigration Services. 
   In contrast, a lawful permanent resident alien hired after the effective date 
   of this interim rule who fails to file for citizenship within six&nbsp;months 
   of eligibility would not be considered a Protected Individual. He or she would 
   only qualify as a Protected Individual upon becoming a U.S. citizen.</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Implementation and Compliance</div>
<p>A number of related policies and forms (e.g.,&nbsp;confidentiality agreements, 
   Intending Citizenship forms) will be updated as a result of these changes. 
   While citizenship requirements pertaining to confidential supervisory information 
   apply to all employees requiring such access, as clarified earlier in this 
   letter, the procedures for Federal Reserve examiners outlined in <a href="/boarddocs/srletters/1994/SR9440.htm">SR&nbsp;letter&nbsp;94-40</a>, 
   &quot;Citizenship Policy and Requirements for Federal Reserve Examiners,&quot; 
   continue to be in effect, including completion of the required Intending Citizenship 
   form. At this time, Reserve Banks should review their internal practices and 
   procedures, and immediately implement enhancements as necessary to comply 
   with the citizenship access requirements. Strong consideration should also 
   be given to ensuring that all employment notices for positions requiring access 
   to confidential supervisory information contain appropriate disclosure about 
   the Federal Reserve's citizenship requirements. </p>
<p>Since the revised policy is newly implemented and has numerous technical provisions 
   requiring compliance, we encourage Reserve Banks with specific situations 
   and questions about applicability to consult frequently and as needed with 
   the appropriate Board staff. Within the Board's Division of Banking Supervision 
   and Regulation, questions concerning the policy should be directed to Cynthia&nbsp;Carter, 
   Senior Supervisory Financial Analyst at (202)&nbsp;452-3633. In the Board's 
   Legal Division, questions concerning the Board's rule on non-citizens, including 
   the County List, should be directed to Alye&nbsp;Foster, Senior Counsel at 
   (202)&nbsp;452-5289.</p>
