<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Debt Elimination Scams</div>
<p>Board staff has become aware of various illegal schemes 
   being offered to the public that purport to eliminate 
   outstanding debt through the use of specially prepared 
   documents. The organizers of these schemes concoct 
   specious legal documents based on the borrower's 
   debt, which are then presented to the borrower's 
   bank, mortgage company, finance company, or other 
   lending institution in an attempt to satisfy the 
   debt.<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
   The scams are reminiscent of the tax protesters' 
   tax evasion schemes seen throughout the 1990s. </p>
<p>The purported legal documents used in the current 
   scams include fake financial instruments that claim 
   to eliminate the borrower's debt obligation.<a href="#Footnote2" name="Footref2" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
   The instruments usually question the authenticity 
   of financial obligations, and often refer to a specific 
   government agency (such as the Federal&nbsp;Reserve) 
   in an attempt to support their claims. Some of the 
   literature seen by Board staff questions the legitimacy 
   of the Federal&nbsp;Reserve and the validity of United&nbsp;States 
   currency. The literature may selectively cite from 
   passages of government publications, statements by 
   politicians, constitutional provisions, court decisions, 
   various statutes, and private newsletters to support 
   claims and to ultimately conclude that a specific 
   government agency sanctions these debt elimination 
   programs. For example, some of the documents specifically 
   refer to the elimination of debt through the use 
   of a &quot;Federal&nbsp;Reserve approved&quot; procedure.</p>
<p>Debt elimination programs that claim Federal&nbsp;Reserve 
   approval or acquiescence and the satisfaction of 
   legitimate debts through the presentation of suspicious 
   documents are totally bogus. The Federal&nbsp;Reserve 
   does not approve and is in no way involved in any 
   program aimed at eliminating anyone's debt obligations. 
</p>
<p>These schemes are proliferating on the Internet, 
   and the organizers are charging borrowers substantial 
   up-front&nbsp;fees and commissions based on the total 
   amount of debt that can be forgiven.<a href="#Footnote3" name="Footref3" title="Footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
   Members of the public are being harmed as borrowers 
   generally pay significant amounts of money without 
   eliminating or reducing their overall debt obligations 
   - which of course is not in fact possible through 
   any of these programs. Also, the cessation of legitimate 
   loan payments increases the risk of a foreclosure 
   or other legal action being taken against the borrower, 
   and in addition could negatively affect a borrower's 
   credit rating. Financial institutions may find that 
   the use of the specious documents complicates the 
   collection process, and may at&nbsp;least temporarily 
   prevent any final action against the consumer. </p>
<p>Examiners and banking organizations should be cognizant 
   of these scams, and the public should avoid becoming 
   involved with them. Bank holding companies and state 
   member banks should modify their policies and procedures 
   as needed to ensure that staff involved in any way 
   in a lending function is able to identify and respond 
   appropriately to these current schemes. If an institution 
   supervised by the Federal&nbsp;Reserve is presented 
   with fraudulent documents as described in this SR&nbsp;letter, 
   the institution is expected to file a Suspicious 
   Activity Report&nbsp;(SAR) in accordance with the 
   Board's suspicious activity reporting rules. The 
   banking organization must also retain the written 
   materials associated with the purported debt elimination 
   scheme as supporting documentation to the SAR, as 
   required by the Board's SAR rules.<a href="#Footnote4" name="Footref4" title="Footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this SR&nbsp;letter 
   to domestic and foreign banking organizations supervised 
   by the Federal&nbsp;Reserve in their districts. Questions 
   regarding apparent fraudulent debt elimination schemes 
   can be directed to Leonard&nbsp;Zawistowski, Senior 
   Special Investigator, at (202)&nbsp;452-6488.</p>

      <li><a name="Footnote1"></a>Lending institutions 
         and insurance companies offer various products 
         or include various terms in loan documents 
         that have the effect of paying off loans (or 
         deferring loan payments for certain periods 
         of time) in the event, for example, of a borrower's 
         death, loss of employment, or other significant 
         personal life changes. These are legitimate 
         products and should not be confused with the 
         false promises to eliminate a borrower's debt 
         upon the presentation of fraudulent documents 
         that are the subject of this alert.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref1">Return&nbsp;to&nbsp;text</a></li>

      <li><a name="Footnote3"></a>Federal Reserve staff 
         has seen advertised up-front fees as high as
