subsidiaries that engage in investment advisory activities
pursuant to Section 225.25 (b)(4) of Regulation Y.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
investment advisory subsidiaries are required to observe the
standards of care and conduct applicable to fiduciaries, it was
suggested in SR 88-11 that examiners specifically trained in
procedures utilized in trust examinations should be called upon
to perform inspections of investment advisory subsidiaries
whenever possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;The enclosed inspection guidelines have been
prepared in response to requests for additional guidance from
Reserve Bank examination personnel.<br>

<b>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</b><br>
<br>
<b>Inspection of Investment Advisory Subsidiaries of Bank Holding Companies</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term &quot;investment adviser&quot; is defined in Section
202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (&quot;the Act&quot;) to
include any person who, for compensation, engages in the business
of advising others, either directly or through publications or
writings, as to the value of securities or as to the advisability
of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities or who, for
compensation and as a part of a regular business, issues or
promulgates analyses or reports concerning securities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Banks</B> are
statutorily excluded from the definition of investment adviser in
the Act provided the performance of such services is incidental
to banking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent bank holding companies, but not bank holding
company subsidiaries, are also statutorily excluded.&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Brokers and
dealers</B> are also excluded provided the performance of such
services is solely incidental to the conduct of their business
and no special compensation is received.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 203(a) prohibits any investment adviser, except
as provided in Section 203(b), from using the mails or any means
or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection with this
investment advisory business, <B>unless registered with the SEC</B>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Section 203(b) provides certain limited exceptions from
registration.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of particular relevance is the exception for those
investment advisers who during the course of the preceding 12
months have had fewer than 15 clients <B>and</B> who do not hold
themselves out generally to the public as an investment adviser.
However, even where an adviser is not required to register it is
nonetheless subject to the anti-fraud provisions contained in
Section 206 of the Act.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complexity of the activities in which investment
adviser subsidiaries engage has continued to increase due to
fundamental changes in both the structure of the financial
services industry itself and the legal and regulatory
environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, services which are primarily of a
fiduciary nature and which were historically performed by bank
trust departments, such as portfolio management and advice, are
increasingly being spun off into separate subsidiaries in order
to create and identify an independent profit center.&nbsp;&nbsp;These
subsidiaries serve as non-asset based sources of revenue for a
bank or bank holding company.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulation Y (Section 225.25(b)(4)), permits a bank
holding company or a nonbank subsidiary to provide portfolio
investment advice to any person (defined in federal statutes to
mean any individual, corporation, trust or other entity) and act
as an investment adviser, as defined in Section 2(a)(20) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 to an investment company
registered under that Act. The Federal Reserve System as the
primary regulator for bank holding companies and their directly
held nonbank subsidiaries conducts inspections of their
operations, financial condition and compliance with banking law
and related regulations.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In furnishing portfolio advice, investment adviser
subsidiaries are required to observe the standards of care and
conduct applicable to fiduciaries (Regulation Y, Section
225.25(b)(4), footnote 1).&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, examiners specifically
trained in procedures utilized in trust examinations should be
called upon to perform the inspections of investment adviser
subsidiaries whenever possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;(See SR-88-11, April 28, 1988)<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registered advisers are subject to supervision and
examination by the SEC.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, SEC examinations of registered
investment advisers are infrequent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, on-site
inspections should be conducted by Federal Reserve Bank examiners
as an integral part of bank holding company inspections whenever
the investment adviser activities are considered to be
significant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual circumstances will determine which
investment adviser subsidiaries should be examined and how often.
Factors to consider include volume and type of activity, date and
results of previous Reserve Bank inspection and/or SEC
examinations and extent of services provided to affiliate banks
or trust companies.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve System does not intend to assume
responsibility for the enforcement of securities laws and
regulations for which the SEC is primarily responsible.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
where Federal Reserve Bank examiners discover potential
violations of securities laws or regulations in the course of an
inspection, Board staff should be advised so that a determination
can be made whether to provide the SEC with information to
investigate the matter or take other appropriate action.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SEC has prepared an Investment Adviser Examination
Manual which may be useful as background information for
evaluating compliance with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
and various SEC rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;The manual contains reference materials
and examinations checklists.&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the SEC manual may be
obtained from the Trust Activities Program. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adviser's financial condition should be reviewed to
insure that the adviser's financial condition is sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may
be a violation of the anti-fraud provision of Section 206 of the
Act for an adviser to continue doing business and solicit new
clients while its financial condition is impaired unless it makes
appropriate disclosure of its financial condition to its clients
and prospective clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that there are no
formal capital standards for investment advisers and there are no
bonding requirements under the Act for the protection of clients
or other creditors.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<p>
<b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspection Objectives</b><br>
<p>
The objectives of an investment adviser inspection are to:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>review the adviser's organizational structure
and qualifications of management to conduct
business and determine whether they are
satisfactory; <br>
<p>
<li>determine whether the adviser's financial
condition and internal accounting controls
are satisfactory; <br>
<p>
<li>review investment practices considering the
adviser's investment responsibilities for the
selection and allocation of investments for
various types of accounts to determine
whether they are appropriate; <br>
<p>
<li>determine whether the institution has
adequate policies and procedures to prevent
self-dealing and similar improper conflicts;  <br>
<p>
<li>to evaluate compliance with applicable bank
holding company laws, regulations and
interpretations including compliance with the
standards of care and conduct applicable to
fiduciaries as required by Regulation Y. <br>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<b>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspection Procedures</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scope of Inspection</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that investment adviser subsidiary
inspections will generally be conducted as part of regularly
scheduled bank holding company inspections.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, however, the
investment adviser subsidiary provides portfolio management
services for a significant portion of trust assets held by
a State member bank, the Reserve Bank should inspect the
investment adviser subsidiary at the same time it examines the
trust operations of the bank subsidiary.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of the inspection should be based upon a review of
the nature and complexity of the financial services provided to
customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;An adviser which merely provides investment advice
and does not provide any additional financial services such as
portfolio management, safekeeping, recordkeeping or trading
services, may not require an inspection.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, an adviser
which provides portfolio management, safekeeping or other
services will require an inspection.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to determine the
scope of the inspection it is essential to identify what types of
services are being offered to customers and to assess the risks
associated with those services.&nbsp;&nbsp;The examiner needs to understand
the adviser's operations, including how it represents itself to
clients and whether the adviser has any vested interests in the
financial services which it offers.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in SR 88-11 (April 28, 1988), examiners should
use their discretion to schedule inspections based upon the size
and complexity of the adviser's operations.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate checklist questions should be completed for
registered investment advisers which provide investment advice to
affiliated banks or trust companies and for investment advisers
which engage in activities which could have a significant impact
on the bank holding company's financial safety and soundness.
The checklist should also be completed for all advisers that
manage investment portfolios for their customers. The checklist
is only a guideline and some of the sections in the checklist may
not be applicable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, the scope of such examinations is
not limited to the items included in this checklist.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspection Checklist</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions in this checklist will assist the examiner in
evaluating various areas of supervisory concerns. <br>
<p>
a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Review of Fundamental Policies and Procedures<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investment advisory's policies and procedures should be
reviewed using the following checklist to ensure that fundamental
policies and procedures have been established and implemented.<br>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Are adequate minutes of the board and board committee
meetings prepared? <br>
<p>
<li>Is the adviser properly chartered and registered? <br>
<p>
<li>Does the adviser have sufficient blanket bond or other
fidelity or liability coverage in place? <br>
<p>
<li>Is the corporate and regulatory reporting performed on
a timely basis? <br>
<p>
<li>Does the reporting fairly present the accounting and
supplemental data reflected by the corporate records? <br>
<p>
<li>Are internal accounting controls, provided by a
segregation of duties or a need for administrative
approvals, adequate? <br>
<p>
<li>Are duties properly segregated in the receiving,
disbursing and recording of cash and cash transactions? <br>
<p>
<li>Are fee calculations and billing procedures adequate to
insure accuracy and propriety? <br>
<p>
<li>Are all security transactions authorized or approved by
the appropriate management level, with evidence of the
authorization or approval documented?<br>
</ul>
<p>
<b>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervision and Organization</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervision refers to the conduct of the institution's board
of directors and senior management in establishing, communicating
and enforcing a system of policies, procedures and practices
suitable to its business objectives and legal requirements.
Organization may be characterized as the framework of committees
and assigned responsibilities through which supervision
functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The examiner should review the structure of the
organization for adequacy of management information systems and
the organization framework as they relate to meeting the
institution's stated responsibilities as well as generally
accepted standards of conduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The examiner should review the institution's supervisory
function by first identifying the duties and responsibilities of
the board of directors.&nbsp;&nbsp;The directors owe the institution the
duty of reasonable supervision, including appropriate attention
to areas where the institution is assuming sensitive and complex
fiduciary responsibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The next level of review is the
committee and officer positions to which certain authority has
been delegated.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reviewing this level of supervision, the
examiner should keep in mind that certain functions cannot be
delegated: for example, approval of significant new services or
lines of business, approval of formal policies designed to ensure
that the institution operates in basic compliance with laws and
regulations, and the selection and supervision of senior
management cannot ordinarily be delegated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal delegations
and operating practices, represent the last level of review.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
reviewing both formal and informal delegations, consideration
should be given to the institution's size and complexity.&nbsp;&nbsp;A
final determination of the adequacy of supervision and
organization must be based upon findings of the entire
inspection.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While topics directly or indirectly impacting the adequacy
of director supervision and management competence are of
particular sensitivity, examiners nevertheless have a
responsibility to carefully address and comment upon such issues. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the inspection the examiner should
review the supervisory and organizational structure of the
institution, with particular reference to investment related
activities. The examiner should determine whether the board of
directors has developed adequate objectives and policies.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following procedures may be used to review the
supervision and organization of an adviser:<br>
<p>
<ol>
<li><B>Obtain</B> or update copies of policy and procedure manuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assure that examiners performing other portions of the inspection receive relevant sections.<br>
<p>
<li><B>Review</B> minutes of board of directors, and of board audit committees, as well as any officer level committees.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assure that examiners performing other portions of the inspection review relevant minutes or summaries thereof.<br>
<p>
<li><B>Obtain</B>, evaluate and summarize matters in litigation (or threatened) and compromise actions.<br>
<p>
<li><B>Ascertain</B> current liability insurance relating to the adviser function; and evaluate the adequacy of such coverage, particularly the extent to which possible significant surcharges would be covered by such insurance.<br>
<p>
<li><B>Obtain</B> or update biographical/experience information for key management personnel, together with overall staffing and salary levels as appropriate for full evaluation.<br>
<p>
<li><B>Ascertain</B> if senior management is aware, or has adopted the procedures necessary to become aware, of its current and potential responsibilities in connection with any regulatory reporting and/or regulatory compliance requirements.<br>
<br>
<li><B>Determine</B> whether operating practices provide for adequate legal documents and agreements such that the account activities, in general, are consistent with contractual responsibilities<br>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment selection comprises the process whereby the
adviser evaluates, selects and re-evaluates those securities it
will buy or sell, or as to which it will make recommendations.
It includes the process of researching and selecting recommended
individual stocks and bonds, and setting objectives or strategies
for diversifications by types and classes of securities into
general or specialized portfolios.&nbsp;&nbsp;It includes the process of
communicating and executing overall strategies for particular
accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding itself out as a professional will result in the
adviser being held to a high standard of prudence and expertise
in the investment selection and review process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore,
advisers must carefully consider policies and procedures in this
area in accordance with the size and character of the investment
selection responsibilities undertaken.&nbsp;&nbsp;In furnishing portfolio
investment advice, an investment adviser should observe the
standards of care and conduct applicable to fiduciaries.<br>

<b>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conflicts of Interests</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The inspection of an investment adviser subsidiary
which provides services to an affiliated trust company or bank
with a trust department requires expanded inspection procedures.
Often the investment adviser subsidiary was organized for the
purpose of providing investment advice and services for the trust
accounts held at one or more of its affiliates.&nbsp;&nbsp;These
subsidiaries often employ the same individuals who worked in the
banks or trust company which they advise.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Conflict of interest problems may arise when the
adviser exercises any &quot;discretion&quot; where mutually opposing
interests are involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most serious conflict of interest is
self-dealing, which could include transactions such as an
investment in affiliated banks or purchase of securities from or
through an affiliate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such transactions and fees associated
therewith must be fully disclosed and authorized by appropriate
parties in interest to resolve conflict of interest issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Potential conflict of interest situations are not limited to
transactions between affiliates but can also be between the
adviser and any of its directors, officers or employees
individually.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the complexity, sensitivity and exposure involved in
conflicts of interest, it is particularly important that an
adviser develop the awareness and policies and procedures to
identify and deal with conflicts situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is
considered highly desirable, even where not specifically required
by regulation, that written policies be adopted and periodically
revised as necessary.<br>

requires an investment adviser to deliver a specified disclosure
statement with respect to its background and business practices
to every client or prospective client.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to an initial
disclosure, the adviser must offer annually to deliver a current
disclosure statement upon request.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those advisers which have
custody or possession of securities of any client must maintain
certain additional records including separate ledger accounts for
each client, copies of confirmations, and a position record

<b>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspection Findings</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written summary of the subsidiary's activities should be
presented to the examiner in charge of the bank holding company
inspection and may be included in the inspection report.
Material exceptions should be noted with management's responses
under an appropriate caption in the open section of the report.
Any comments in the report regarding the scope of the investment
advisory inspections should note that such inspections are
primarily focused on safety and soundness considerations and not
on compliance with securities laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those cases where a separate Report of Bank Holding
Company Inspection on Investment Advisory Activities is prepared
examiners may utilize the Uniform Interagency Trust Rating System
(SR 82-28 FRB, revised 5/82) which provides a basis for the
evaluation of critical areas of supervisory concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rating
system is generally used by federal supervisory agencies to
assess the condition of trust institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;However the system
can be adopted to report on advisory operations as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the inspection uncovers significant deficiencies which
require corrective action, and the inspection was <B>not</B> done in
conjunction with a concurrent bank holding company inspection, a
separate report should be prepared and delivered to the examined
institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Send a copy of the summary and any report comments
to the Trust Activities Program, Washington D.C., 20551.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
