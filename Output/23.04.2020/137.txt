<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Interagency 
  Interpretive Guidance on the Provision of Banking 
  Services to Money Services Businesses Operating in 
  the United States</div>
<!-- single space -->
<p>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the 
  Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Thrift Supervision, 
  and National Credit Union Administration, along with 
  the U.S.&nbsp;Department of the Treasury's Financial 
  Crimes Enforcement Network&nbsp;(FinCEN), have issued 
  the attached interagency interpretive guidance for 
  banking organizations to clarify the requirements 
  of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering 
  regulations in relation to the provision of banking 
  services to money services businesses&nbsp;(MSBs) 
  operating in the United&nbsp;States. The interagency 
  guidance is a follow up to the joint statement issued 
  on March&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2005, and will be incorporated 
  into the interagency BSA/AML examination procedures 
  that are scheduled for release on June&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2005. 
  In addition to the issuance of the interagency interpretive 
  guidance, FinCEN has issued related guidance to the 
  MSB industry on BSA compliance.</p>
<p>The interagency guidance 
  seeks to clarify existing requirements rather than 
  to create new requirements or impose additional burdens 
  on banking organizations. Given that MSBs vary widely 
  in their operations and the levels of risks presented, 
  the guidance addresses the need for banking organizations 
  to assess risks associated with their different MSB 
  accounts, and provides examples of potential indicators 
  of low and high risk MSB accounts. The guidance outlines 
  regulators' expectations for minimum due diligence 
  on all MSB accounts and describes enhanced due diligence 
  that may be appropriate for accounts identified as 
  higher risk. The guidance also addresses the issues 
  of filing Suspicious Activity Reports and account 
  closure. </p>
<p>The guidance encourages 
  banking organizations to direct questions about BSA 
  obligations and the provision of banking services 
  to MSBs to FinCEN or their primary federal regulators; 
  thus, it is expected that you may receive inquiries 
  from banking organizations in your district. To ensure 
  that the System provides consistent information on 
  this subject, responses should be coordinated through 
  Bridget&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Neill, Manager, Anti-Money Laundering 
  Policy and Compliance Section, Division of Banking 
  Supervision and Regulation, at the Board. </p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked 
  to distribute this SR&nbsp;letter to the domestic 
  and foreign banking organizations supervised by the 
  Federal Reserve, as well as to supervisory and examination 
  staff. If you have any questions, please contact Nina&nbsp;Nichols, 
  Senior Counsel, Enforcement Section, at (202)&nbsp;452-2961, 
  or Bridget&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Neill, at (202)&nbsp;452-5235.</p>
