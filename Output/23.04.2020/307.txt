		  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			 federal banking regulators have issued the attached press release announcing the issuance of 
			 a joint interagency statement that provides comprehensive guidance on retail sales of nondeposit 
			 investment products occurring on or from depository institution premises.&nbsp;&nbsp;The interagency 
			 statement unifies the pronouncements issued by the banking agencies last year addressing various 
			 aspects of retail sales programs involving mutual funds, annuities and other nondeposit investment 
			 products.&nbsp;&nbsp;The press release summarizes the most pertinent aspects of the interagency 
			 statement.<br>
		  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			 interagency statement, which is being distributed with this &quot;SR&quot; Letter, supersedes 
			 our June 17, 1993 and June 6, 1991 &quot;SR&quot; Letters (SR 93-25 (FIS) and SR 91-14 (FIS), 
			 respectively).&nbsp;&nbsp;Those &quot;SR&quot; Letters covered some, but not all, of the issues 
			 addressed by the attached interagency statement.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
		  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			 interagency statement applies to all depository institutions, including state member banks, 
			 and the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks under the Board's supervision.&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
			 emphasizes the importance of adopting comprehensive policies and procedures governing sales 
			 programs, and includes directions relating to the following matters: disclosure and advertising; 
			 the use of identical and similar named products; the separation of sales programs; the training 
			 and supervision of personnel; sales practices and suitability; and third party arrangements.<br>
		  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due 
			 to the importance of this matter, the attached press release and interagency statement should 
			 be sent by your Reserve Bank to the chief executive officer of each bank holding company, state 
			 member bank and U.S. branch and agency of a foreign bank in your District.&nbsp;&nbsp;A suggested 
			 transmittal letter is attached. <br>
		  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserve 
			 Banks should continue to review banking organizations' nondeposit investment product sales activities. 
			 During the next examination or inspection of an institution engaging in such activities on its 
			 premises, either directly or through a third party or an affiliate, the review process should, 
			 at a minimum, include an assessment of whether the interagency statement is being followed, 
			 particularly with regard to the nature and sufficiency of an institution's disclosures, the 
			 separation of functions, and the training of personnel involved with the sales of mutual funds 
			 and other nondeposit products.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
			 Federal Reserve System task force is now being formed under the direction of James I. Garner, 
			 Deputy Associate Director, to address examination and supervisory issues related to the sales 
			 of nondeposit investment products by banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve.&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
			 task force is developing examination guidelines and specific procedures that would be used by 
			 Reserve Bank examiners during the course of their reviews.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event you have 
			 any questions about what interim steps should be taken pending the completion of the task force's 
			 assignment, please contact Kevin J. Rochford, Senior Supervisory Financial Analyst, at (202)&nbsp;452-2278.<br>
		  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
			 the event you have any questions concerning the interagency statement, please contact Angela 
			 Desmond, Senior Attorney, at (202)&nbsp;452-3497, or Richard Ashton, Associate General Counsel, 
			 at (202)&nbsp;452-3750.<br>
