<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Account Management 
   and Loss Allowance Methodology for Credit Card Lending</div>
<p>On January&nbsp;8,&nbsp;2003, the Federal Reserve, 
   along with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 
   the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the 
   Office of Thrift Supervision, under the auspices 
   of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination 
   Council, issued the attached supervisory account 
   management and loss allowance guidance for credit 
   card lending.&nbsp; The agencies developed the guidance 
   to clarify expectations regarding account management, 
   risk management, and loss allowance practices with 
   respect to this activity. </p>
<p>In addition to setting forth supervisory expectations 
   with regard to credit line management, over-limit 
   practices, minimum payments and negative amortization, 
   and workout and forbearance practices, the guidance 
   clarifies various reporting requirements related 
   to income recognition and loss allowance practices. 
</p>
<p>The final guidance differs in some respects from 
   the draft guidance issued on July&nbsp;22,&nbsp;2002, 
   for informal industry review.&nbsp; In particular, 
   the final guidance notes that workout programs should 
   generally strive to have borrowers repay credit card 
   debt within 60&nbsp;months.&nbsp; The draft guidance 
   noted that workout programs should be generally consistent 
   with certain debt management plans typically structured 
   to result in repayment within 48&nbsp;months.&nbsp; 
   While the draft guidance combined the discussion 
   of over-limit practices and negative amortization, 
   the final guidance separately addresses these two&nbsp;issues.&nbsp; 
   The final guidance discussion of line increase programs, 
   as well as income recognition and loss allowance 
   practices, remains substantively unchanged from the 
   July&nbsp;draft guidance.</p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this SR&nbsp;letter 
   to the banking organizations supervised by the Federal 
   Reserve that engage in credit card lending as well 
   as to supervisory staff.&nbsp; Questions may be directed 
   to Arleen&nbsp;Lustig, Supervisory Financial Analyst 
   (202)&nbsp;452-2987; Barbara&nbsp;Bouchard, Assistant 
   Director (202)&nbsp;452-3072; or Norah&nbsp;Barger, 
   Deputy Associate Director (202)&nbsp;452-2402.</p>
