ENCLOSURES ELECTRONICALLY TRANSMITTED BELOW<br>
<p>
<br>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
<b>Application and Supervision Standards for De Novo State Member Banks</b><br>
<p>
<b>Definitions</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this policy a de novo bank is defined
as a state member bank that has been in operation for five years
or less.&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy also extends to commercial banks that have
been in existence for less than five years and subsequently
convert to membership.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrifts, Edge Act Companies and
industrial banks that are converting to membership, irrespective
of their length of existence, are subject to the de novo policy
because they have not demonstrated operating stability as a
commercial bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;These institutions will hereafter be referred
to as converted banks for purposes of this policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy is
being extended to de novo banks through the fifth year of
existence because experience indicates that pronounced problems
often surface during the fourth and fifth years of operations for
new banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;These problems are frequently the result of
inexperienced management, management and director changes,
director dissension or lack of involvement and poor lending
practices during the early years.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
<p>
<b>De Novo Bank Subsidiaries of Bank Holding Companies with Assets Greater than $1 Billion</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;De novo state member bank subsidiaries of holding
companies are subject to this policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the de novo
examination frequency guidelines may be waived for de novo
subsidiaries of large bank holding companies (consolidated assets
greater than $1 billion) if, in the opinion of the Reserve Bank,
the parent company and its subsidiary banks are in satisfactory
condition, and the parent is considered to be a source of
strength to the bank subsidiaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding, such
subsidiary state member banks would be expected to maintain
capital in conformance with the de novo policy guideline.<br>
 <b><br>
<p>
Notice of Application to FDIC</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with existing procedures, the Reserve
Bank should notify the FDIC when it receives membership
applications for de novo banks and thereby allow the FDIC the
opportunity to provide material comments that could affect the
Board's consideration of the application.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriate
Regional Office of the FDIC should be sent one copy of the de
novo bank membership application at the time of filing in final
form.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Reserve Bank should provide a copy of
letters received from the FDIC to the applicant if the letter is
adverse in nature or presents material information not already
clearly in the record.<br>
<p>
<p>
 <b>Capital Standards</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial capital in a de novo state member bank should
be reasonable in relation to State law, its location, business
plan and competitive environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;At a minimum, however, a de
novo bank must maintain a tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9
percent for the first three years of operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;(The 9 percent
Tier 1 leverage ratio, which excludes loan loss reserves, is
generally consistent with the former 10 percent primary capital
guideline, which included loan loss reserves.)&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant
must provide projections of asset growth and earnings performance
that reasonably support the bank's ability to maintain this ratio
without reliance on additional capital injections.&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy
also applies to newly converted commercial banks through the
third year of existence and generally to other types of
institutions that become Federal Reserve members (e.g.,
industrial banks, thrift, and Edge Act Companies) for a three
year period beginning from the date following consummation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
exceptions to this policy for converted banks should be discussed
with Board staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though a 9 percent tangible leverage
ratio is not required after year three, de novo banks are
expected to maintain capital ratios commensurate with ongoing
safety and soundness concerns and, generally, well in excess of
regulatory minimums. <br>
<p>
<p>
 <b>Outside Directors</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directors with prior banking experience provide a de
novo institution with additional managerial strength.
Accordingly,  the board of directors of a de novo bank normally
should include at least two outside directors with prior banking-related experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;This recommendation also applies to de novo
state member bank subsidiaries of large holding companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
such cases the outside directors for the bank could be drawn from
the parent company management or board.&nbsp;&nbsp;This guideline may be
waived if, in the opinion of the Reserve Bank, it will be
difficult to find outside directors with prior banking
experience, as may be the case for institutions located in rural
areas.<br>
<p>
<b>Qualifications and Notification Requirements of Senior Management Officials and Directors</b>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with procedures enumerated in SR-88-8
(STR) (3/18/88), each proposed director of a de novo bank is
subject to a &quot;name check&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, pursuant to Section 914
of FIRREA which amended Regulation Y, any insured depository
institution that has been in operation for less than two years
shall notify the Reserve Bank at least 30 days before the
proposed addition of any individual to the board of directors or
the employment, promotion or transfer of any individual as a
senior executive officer.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reserve Bank must state either a
&quot;no objection&quot; or &quot;disapproval&quot; of the individual by the end of
the 30-day period beginning on the date the notification is
accepted.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those instances where there is a conflict between
the System's need to verify an official's qualifications and a
request that a present employer not be contacted, appropriate and
reasonable steps should be taken to satisfy the System's need to
know.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Reserve Banks have delegated authority to make
these decisions, they are encouraged to consult with Board staff
when necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is decided that information is available
through alternative means, it may not be necessary to contact
present employers.&nbsp;&nbsp;In those cases where it is deemed necessary
to contact present employers, the applicant should be given
notice of the decision before the contact is made.<br>
<p>
 <b>Meeting with the Board of Directors</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserve Banks should advise applicants of all
membership requirements when an application is initially filed.
In addition, prior to approval, Reserve Bank staff should meet
with the full board of directors to discuss applicable statutes,
regulations, policies, and supervisory procedures and to become
better acquainted with the organizers.&nbsp;&nbsp;After an application is
approved, but before the bank is opened, the Reserve Bank should
meet with the directorate to reiterate the System's expectations
for newly formed institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reserve Bank should again
apprise the directors of their individual and group
responsibilities, particularly as they apply to Regulation O and
Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors
should also be made aware of their fiduciary responsibilities and
the need for adherence to sound operating policies, including the
written policies reviewed and found satisfactory by Reserve Bank
staff.<br>
<p>
<p>
 <b>Approval Letters</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of FIRREA, a cease and desist order
can be issued and civil money penalties can be assessed for
noncompliance with written conditions that are incorporated in an
approval order or letter which grants membership to a bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Accordingly, conditions imposed are to be incorporated in the
approval letter.&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be stressed to the organizers and
directors that conditions imposed during the application process
are legally binding and subject to enforcement.<br>
<p>
<b>Cash Flows to a BHC Parent</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current small one bank holding company
policy, de novo banks are restricted from providing funds for
servicing the parent's debt until the bank receives two
consecutive CAMEL ratings of &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot;, based on full scope
examinations, and, in the judgment of the Reserve Bank, can be
expected to continue operating on a sound basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;An exception to
this prohibition is tax payments that are made in accordance with
the Board's policy under Regulation Y.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, if debt is
included in a small bank holding company's formation application
(debt to equity ratio is not to exceed 1:1), the applicant must
clearly indicate how this debt will be serviced from sources
other than the de novo bank, such as contributions from
principals.<br>
<p>
<b>Written Policies</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the application process organizers of de novo banks
are required to submit copies of the proposed bank's business
plan, Community Reinvestment Act policy, investment policy,
asset/liability management policy, and loan policy (including the
percentage of the loan account allocated to commercial,
installment, real estate and agricultural loans).&nbsp;&nbsp;It is
recommended that these policies be reviewed by the Reserve Bank
supervision or other appropriate staff prior to accepting the
application.&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, any employment agreements, compensation
packages and management fee arrangements should also be reviewed
to determine their consistency with applicable policies.<br>
<p>
<b>Examination Frequency</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reserve Bank should conduct a limited-scope
examination at the end of the de novo bank or converted bank's
first quarter of operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The examiner should review, at a
minimum:&nbsp;&nbsp;the minutes of board of directors' meetings; management
information and control systems; the loan portfolio, including
underwriting standards, concentrations, transactions with insiders,
etc.; the sources of the bank's deposits; and compliance with
reporting requirements on large currency transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the
examiner should review major expenditures, including salaries,
compensation packages and other related benefits; compare operating
results for consistency with projections in the application; and
determine whether the business and operating plans are consistent
with those presented in the application and whether they need
modification.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon completion of the limited-scope 
examination, a written report should be submitted to the board of directors 
and to the Board (Attn:&nbsp;&nbsp;BS&amp;R Clearing Unit for transmittal 
to...).&nbsp;&nbsp;A CAMEL rating would normally not be assigned after this initial
examination.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to better assess the condition of the bank
and the parent bank holding company in the context of the
application, it is suggested that Reserve Bank application staff
also participate in the initial examination when possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the bank has been in operation for a further six-month period, the Reserve Bank should conduct a full-scope
examination.&nbsp;&nbsp;At six-month intervals, thereafter, full-scope
examinations should be conducted until the bank receives two
consecutive CAMEL composite ratings of &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; and, in the
judgment of the Reserve Bank, can be expected to continue operating
on a sound basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when a bank's composite rating declines
to a CAMEL &quot;3&quot; (after two consecutive composite ratings of &quot;2&quot; or
better) at anytime during the first five years of operation, the
Reserve Bank should, thereafter, conduct a full-scope examination
at six-month intervals until the composite rating improves to a &quot;2&quot;
or better for two consecutive examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bank has
received two consecutive CAMEL composite ratings of two or better
and Reserve Bank staff is of the opinion that the bank will
continue to operate on a sound basis, the standard examination
schedule may be followed.<br>
<p>
<b>Surveillance Tracking System</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the monitoring process, the Reserve Bank
should establish appropriate programs for tracking the financial
performance of a de novo and converted state member bank for the
first five years of operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;One feature of the tracking system
should include the comparison of the bank's quarterly results with
the projections in the application.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, an ongoing
reporting system should be required from approval to actual opening
date to track any non-financial occurrences in the interim such as
additions to or deletions from the board of directors or changes
made to written policies reviewed and found acceptable by Reserve
Bank staff.<br>
<p>
<b>Other Considerations</b><br>
<p>
Diversification of the Directorate<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Experience has shown that when a bank's directorate is
composed of persons with a variety of professional expertise,
overall managerial guidance is strengthened.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly,
diversification of the board of directors should be strongly
encouraged.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</ul>
<p>
Annual Outside Audits<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>De novos and converted banks should be strongly encouraged to
have annual outside audits for at least the first five years
of operation. <br>
</ul>
<p>
Supervisory Action<br>
<ul>
<li>Given the rapid deterioration experienced by some de novo
banks, a timely supervisory response to address problem areas
is particularly important.&nbsp;&nbsp;When weaknesses are first
detected, prompt supervisory action should be taken by the
Reserve Bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;If these weaknesses aren't immediately
corrected, or if they could lead to serious problems, formal
enforcement action should be initiated.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Processing</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Board staff requests that de novos and converted banks be
identified on summary form F.R. 1418 and on the cover of the
examination report.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quarterly surveillance data on such banks are
to be submitted to the applicable District Review Analysts at the
Board.<br>
