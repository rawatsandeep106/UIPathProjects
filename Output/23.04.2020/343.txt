&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the many basic tenets of internal control is that a banking
organization ensure that employees in sensitive positions be absent from their
duties for a minimum of two consecutive weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a requirement enhances the
viability of a sound internal control environment because most frauds or
embezzlements require the continual presence of the wrongdoer.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of recent events involving significant trading losses caused by
illegal activities, we believe that it is necessary to reemphasize the importance of
this internal control procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, we request that you send the attached
guidance to each domestic and foreign banking organization supervised by the
Federal Reserve in your district.&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of a suggested transmittal letter is also
attached.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the attachments, we emphasize that each banking organization
should assess its significant risk areas before developing a policy regarding this
matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;After making this assessment, the organization should require that
employees in sensitive key positions, such as trading and wire transfer, not be
allowed to transact or otherwise carryout, either physically or through electronic
access, their assigned duties for a minimum of two consecutive weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
prescribed period of absence should, under all circumstances, be sufficient in
duration to allow all pending transactions to clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also require that an
individual's daily work be processed by another employee during the employee's
absence.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have any questions regarding this guidance, please contact the
appropriate Board officer responsible for domestic or foreign bank supervision.<br>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In brief, the guidance is intended to ensure that each banking
organization conducts an assessment of significant risk areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;After conducting
this assessment, the organization should, with few exceptions, require that
employees in sensitive key positions, such as trading and wire transfer, not be
allowed to transact or otherwise carryout, either physically or through electronic
access, their assigned duties for a minimum of two consecutive weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;The

<br>
FROM SENSITIVE POSITIONS</center></font>
<p>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive system of internal controls is essential for a financial
institution to safeguard its assets and capital, and avoid undue reputational and legal
risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the responsibility of senior management to establish an appropriate system
of internal controls and to monitor compliance with that system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although no single
control element should be relied upon to prevent fraud and abuse, these acts are
more easily perpetrated when proper segregation and rotation of duties do not exist.
As a result, the Federal Reserve is reemphasizing the following prudent banking
practices that should be incorporated into an institution's internal control procedures.
These practices are designed to enhance the viability of a sound internal control
environment in that most internal frauds or embezzlements necessitate the constant
presence of the offender to prevent the detection of illegal activities.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When developing comprehensive internal control procedures, each
institution should first make a critical assessment of significant areas and sensitive
positions.&nbsp;&nbsp;This assessment should consider all employees, but should focus on those
with authority to execute transactions, signing authority and access to the books and
records of the banking organization, as well as those employees who can influence or
cause such activities to occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;Particular attention should be paid to areas engaged in
trading and wire transfer operations, including personnel who also may have
reconciliation or other back office responsibilities.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After producing a profile of high risk areas and activities, it would be
expected that a minimum of two consecutive weeks absence be required of
employees in sensitive positions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The prescribed period of absence should, under all
circumstances, be of sufficient duration to allow all pending transactions to clear, and
to provide for an independent monitoring of the transactions that the absent employee
is responsible for initiating or processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;This practice could be implemented through
either a requirement that affected employees take vacation or leave, the rotation of
assignments in lieu of required vacation, or a combination of both so the prescribed
level of absence is attained.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some institutions, particularly smaller ones, might
consider compensating controls such as continuous rotation of assignments in lieu of
required absences, so as not to place an undue burden on the institution or its
employees.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals having electronic access to systems and records from remote
locations must be denied such access during their absence for the policy to be
effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, indirect access can be controlled by not allowing others to take
and carry out instructions from the absent employee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of primary importance is the
requirement that an individual's daily work be processed by another employee during
his or her absence.&nbsp;&nbsp;This process is essential to bring to the forefront any unusual
activity of the absent employee.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions to this policy may be necessary from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
management should exercise the appropriate discretion and properly document any
waivers that are granted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal auditing should be made aware of these individuals
and the circumstances necessitating the exceptions.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an institution's internal control procedures do not now include the
above practices, they should be promptly amended.&nbsp;&nbsp;After the procedures have been
enhanced, they should be disseminated to all employees, and the documentation
regarding receipt and acknowledgement maintained.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, adherence to the
procedures should be included in the appropriate audit schedules, and audit should
be cognizant of potential electronic access or other circumventing opportunities.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development and implementation of procedures on required
absences from sensitive positions is just one element of an adequate control
environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each banking organization should take all measures to establish
appropriate policies, limits, and verification procedures for an effective overall risk
management system.<p>
