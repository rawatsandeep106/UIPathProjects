&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review of risk management and internal controls is
an essential element of our  examination of trading activities.
In view of the increasing importance of these activities to the
overall risk profile and profitability of certain banking
organizations, the following guidance is being issued to
highlight key considerations in examining the risk management and
internal controls of trading activities in both cash and
derivative instruments.<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></a> <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This guidance specifically targets trading, market
making, and customer accommodation activities in cash and
derivative instruments at State member banks, branches and
agencies of foreign banks, and Edge corporations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles
set forth in this guidance also apply to the risk management of
bank holding companies, which should manage and control aggregate
risk exposures on a consolidated basis, while recognizing legal
distinctions among subsidiaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the principles advanced
can also be applied to banks' use of derivatives as end-users.
Examiners should assess management's application of this guidance
to the holding company and to a bank's end-user derivative
activities where appropriate, given the nature of the
institution's activities and current accounting standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following guidance both reiterates and supplements
earlier directives provided in various supervisory letters and
examination manuals on these topics.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also incorporated and
addressed in significant detail in the draft Capital Markets and
Trading Activities Manual that is currently being field tested.
Specifically, this letter provides examiner guidance for
evaluating the following elements of an institution's risk
management process for trading and derivatives activities:<br>
<p>

</table>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In assessing the adequacy of these elements at
individual institutions, examiners should consider the nature and
volume of a bank's activities and the bank's overall approach
toward managing the various types of risks involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the
examination of other banking activities, examiner judgment plays
a key role in assessing the adequacy and necessary sophistication
of a bank's risk management system for cash and derivative
instrument trading and hedging activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the managerial and examiner practices contained
in this guidance are fundamental and are generally accepted as
sound banking practices for both trading and non-trading
activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, other elements may be subject to change, as
both supervisory and bank operating standards evolve in response
to new technologies, financial innovations, and developments in
market and business practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;Future experience, including that
gained from implementing the Capital Markets and Trading
Activities Manual, may also identify useful changes to these
examiner guidelines. <br>
<p>
 <b>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oversight of the Risk Management Process</b> <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is standard practice for most banking activities,
banks should maintain written policies and procedures that
clearly outline the institution's risk management guidance for
trading and derivative activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;At a minimum these policies
should identify the risk tolerances of the board of directors and
should clearly delineate lines of authority and responsibility
for managing the risk of these activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals
throughout the trading and derivatives areas should be fully
aware of all policies and procedures that relate to their
specific duties.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board of directors, senior-level management, and
members of independent risk management functions are all
important participants in the risk management process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners
should ensure that these participants are aware of their
responsibilities and that they adequately perform their
appropriate role in managing the risk of trading and derivative
activities. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Board of Directors.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The board of directors should
approve all significant policies relating to the management of
risks throughout the institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;These policies, which should
include those related to trading activities, should be consistent
with the organization's broader business strategies, capital
adequacy, expertise, and overall willingness to take risk.
Accordingly, the board should be informed regularly of the risk
exposure of the institution and should regularly re-evaluate
significant risk management policies and procedures with special
emphasis placed on those defining the institution's risk
tolerance regarding these activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The board of directors
should also conduct and encourage discussions between its members
and senior management, as well as between senior management and
others in the institution, regarding the institution's risk
management process and risk exposure. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Senior Management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Senior management is responsible
for ensuring that there are adequate policies and procedures for
conducting trading operations on both a long-range and day-to-day
basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;This responsibility includes ensuring that there are
clear delineations of lines of responsibility for managing risk,
adequate systems for measuring risk, appropriately structured
limits on risk taking, effective internal controls, and a
comprehensive risk-reporting process.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior management should evaluate regularly the
procedures in place to manage risk to ensure that those
procedures are appropriate and sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior management should
also foster and participate in active discussions with the board,
with staff of risk management functions, and with traders
regarding procedures for measuring and managing risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management
must also ensure that trading and derivative activities are
allocated sufficient resources and staff to manage and control
risks. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Independent Risk Management Functions.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of
measuring, monitoring, and controlling risk consistent with the
established policies and procedures should be managed
independently of individuals conducting trading activities, up
through senior levels of the institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;An independent system
for reporting exposures to both senior-level management and to
the board of directors is an important element of this process.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking organizations should have highly qualified
personnel throughout their trading and derivatives areas,
including their risk management and internal control functions.
The personnel staffing independent risk management functions
should have a complete understanding of the risks associated with
all traded on- and off-balance sheet instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly,
compensation policies for these individuals should be adequate to
attract and retain personnel qualified to judge these risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a matter of general policy, compensation policies, especially in
the risk management, control, and senior management functions,
should be structured in a way that avoids the potential
incentives for excessive risk taking that can occur if, for
example, salaries are tied too closely to the profitability of
trading or derivatives activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
 <b>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Risk Management Process</b> <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary components of a sound risk management
process are:&nbsp;&nbsp;a comprehensive risk measurement approach; a
detailed structure of limits, guidelines, and other parameters
used to govern risk taking; and a strong management information
system for monitoring and reporting risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;These components are
fundamental to both trading and non-trading activities, alike.
Moreover, the underlying risks associated with these activities,
such as credit, market, liquidity, and operating risk, are not
new to banking, although their measurement and management can be
somewhat more complex.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the process of risk
management for trading activities should be integrated into the
institution's overall risk management system to the fullest
extent possible using a conceptual framework common to the bank's
other activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a common framework enables the
institution to manage its consolidated risk exposure more
effectively, especially since the various individual risks
involved in trading activities can, at times, be interconnected
and can often transcend specific markets.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is the case with all risk-bearing activities, the
risk exposures a banking organization assumes in its trading and
derivatives activities should be fully supported by an adequate
capital position.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking organizations should ensure that their
capital positions are sufficiently strong to support all trading
and derivatives risks on a fully consolidated basis and that
adequate capital is maintained in all affiliated entities engaged
in these activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Risk Measurement.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;An institution's system for
measuring the various risks of trading and derivatives activities
should be both comprehensive and accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Risks should be
measured and aggregated across trading and non-trading activities
on an institution-wide basis to the fullest extent possible. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While examiners should not require the use of a single
prescribed risk measurement approach for management purposes,
they should evaluate the extent to which a bank's procedures
enable management to assess exposures on a consolidated basis.
Examiners should also evaluate whether the risk measures and the
risk measurement process are sufficiently robust to reflect
accurately the multiple types of risks facing the institution.
Risk measurement standards should be understood by relevant
personnel at all levels of the institution--from individual
traders to the board of directors--and should provide a common
framework for limiting and monitoring risk taking activities. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The process of marking trading and derivatives
positions to market is fundamental to measuring and reporting
exposures accurately and on a timely basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Institutions active
in dealing foreign exchange, derivatives, and other traded
instruments should have the ability to monitor credit exposures,
trading positions, and market movements at least daily.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some
institutions should also have the capacity, or at least the goal,
of monitoring their more actively traded products on a real-time
basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing stress situations, including combinations of
market events that could affect the banking organization, is also
an important aspect of risk measurement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound risk measurement
practices include identifying possible events or changes in
market behavior that could have unfavorable effects on the bank
and assessing the ability of the bank to withstand them.&nbsp;&nbsp;These
analyses should consider not only the likelihood of adverse
events, reflecting their probability, but also plausible &quot;worst
case&quot; scenarios.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, such worst case analysis should be
conducted on an institution-wide basis by taking into account the
effect of unusual price changes or the default of a large
counterparty across both the derivatives and cash trading
portfolios and the loan and funding portfolios.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such stress tests should not be limited to quantitative
exercises that compute potential losses or gains.&nbsp;&nbsp;They should
also include more qualitative analyses of the actions management
might take under particular scenarios.&nbsp;&nbsp;Contingency plans
outlining operating procedures and lines of communication, both
formal and informal, are important products of such qualitative
analyses.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Limiting Risks.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A sound system of integrated
institution-wide limits and risk-taking guidelines is an
essential component of the risk management process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a
system should set boundaries for organizational risk-taking and
should also ensure that positions that exceed certain
predetermined levels receive prompt management attention, so that
they can be either reduced or prudently addressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The limit
system should be consistent with the effectiveness of the
organization's overall risk management process and with the
adequacy of its capital position.&nbsp;&nbsp;An appropriate limit system
should permit management to control exposures, to initiate
discussion about opportunities and risks, and to monitor actual
risk taking against predetermined tolerances, as determined by
the board of directors and senior management. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global limits should be set for each major type of risk
involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;These limits should be consistent with the bank's
overall risk measurement approach and should be integrated to the
fullest extent possible with institution-wide limits on those
risks as they arise in all other activities of the firm.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
limit system should provide the capability to allocate limits
down to individual business units.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times, especially when markets are volatile, traders
may exceed their limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;While such exceptions may occur, they
should be made known to senior management and approved only by
authorized personnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;These positions should also prompt
discussions between traders and management about the consolidated
risk-taking activities of the firm or the trading unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
seriousness of individual or continued limit exceptions depends
in large part upon management's approach toward setting limits
and on the actual size of individual and organizational limits
relative to the institution's capacity to take risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks with
relatively conservative limits may encounter more exceptions to
those limits than do institutions where limits may be less
restrictive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, examiners should ensure that stated
policies are enforced and that the level of exposure is managed
prudently.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Reporting</b>. An accurate, informative, and timely
management information system is essential to the prudent
operation of a trading or derivatives activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the
examiner's assessment of the quality of the management
information system is an important factor in the overall
evaluation of the risk management process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should
determine the extent to which the risk management function
monitors and reports its measures of trading risks to appropriate
levels of senior management and to the board of directors.
Exposures and profit and loss statements should be reported at
least daily to managers who supervise but do not, themselves,
conduct trading activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;More frequent reports should be made
as market conditions dictate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reports to other levels of senior
management and the board may occur less frequently, but examiners
should determine whether the frequency of reporting provides
these individuals with adequate information to judge the changing
nature of the institution's risk profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should ensure that the management information
systems translate the measured risk from a technical and
quantitative format to one that can be easily read and understood
by senior managers and directors, who may not have specialized
and technical knowledge of trading activities and derivative
products.&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk exposures arising from various products within
the trading function should be reported to senior managers and
directors using a common conceptual framework for measuring and
limiting risks.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Management Evaluation and Review</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management should
ensure that the various components of a bank's risk management
process are regularly reviewed and evaluated.&nbsp;&nbsp;This review should
take into account changes in the activities of the institution
and in the market environment, since the changes may have created
exposures that require additional management and examiner
attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any material changes to the risk management system
should also be reviewed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The independent risk management functions should
regularly assess the methodologies, models, and assumptions used
to measure risk and to limit exposures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Proper documentation of
these elements of the risk measurement system is essential for
conducting meaningful reviews.&nbsp;&nbsp;The review of limit structures
should compare limits to actual exposures and should also
consider whether existing measures of exposure and limits are
appropriate in view of the bank's past performance and current
capital position. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequency and extent to which banks should re-evaluate their risk measurement methodologies and models depends,
in part, on the specific risk exposures created by their trading
activities, on the pace and nature of market changes, and on the
pace of innovation with respect to measuring and managing risks.
At a minimum, banks with significant trading and derivative
activities should review the underlying methodologies of their
models at least annually--and more often as market conditions
dictate--to ensure they are appropriate and consistent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such
internal evaluations may, in many cases, be supplemented by
reviews by external auditors or other qualified outside parties,
such as consultants who have expertise with highly technical
models and risk management techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assumptions should be
evaluated on a continual basis. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks should also have an effective process to evaluate
and review the risks involved in products that are either new to
the firm or new to the marketplace and of potential interest to
the firm.&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, a bank should not trade a product until
senior management and all relevant personnel (including those in
risk management, internal control, legal, accounting, and
auditing) understand the product and are able to integrate the
product into the bank's risk measurement and control systems.
Examiners should determine whether the banking organization has a
formal process for reviewing new products and whether it
introduces new products in a manner that adequately limits
potential losses. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Managing Specific Risks.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The following discussions
present examiner guidance for evaluating the specific components
of a firm's risk management process in the context of each of the
risks involved in trading cash and derivatives instruments.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Credit Risk.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly defined, credit risk is the risk
that a counterparty will fail to perform on an obligation to the
banking institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks should evaluate both settlement and
pre-settlement credit risk at the customer level across all
traded derivative and non-derivative products.&nbsp;&nbsp;On settlement
day, the exposure to counterparty default may equal the full
value of any cash flows or securities the bank is to receive.
Prior to settlement, credit risk is measured as the sum of the
replacement cost of the position, plus an estimate of the bank's
potential future exposure from the instrument as a result of
market changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Replacement cost should be determined using
current market prices or generally accepted approaches for
estimating the present value of future payments required under
each contract, given current market conditions. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential credit risk exposure is measured more
subjectively than current exposure and is primarily a function of
the time remaining to maturity and the expected volatility of the
price, rate, or index underlying the contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often
assessed through simulation analysis and option valuation models,
but can also be addressed by using &quot;add-ons,&quot; such as those
included in the risk-based capital standard.&nbsp;&nbsp;In either case,
examiners should evaluate the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying the bank's risk measure and should also ensure that
banks that measure exposures using a portfolio approach do so in
a prudent manner. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master netting agreements and various credit
enhancements, such as collateral or third-party guarantees, can
be used by banks to reduce their counterparty credit risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
such cases, a bank's credit exposures should reflect these risk
reducing features only to the extent that the agreements and
recourse provisions are legally enforceable in all relevant
jurisdictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;This legal enforceability should extend to any
insolvency proceedings of the counterparty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks should be able
to demonstrate that they have exercised due diligence in
evaluating the enforceability of these contracts and that
individual transactions have been executed in a manner that
provides adequate protection to the bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Credit limits that consider both settlement and pre-settlement exposures should be established for all counterparties
with whom the bank trades.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of general policy,
trading with a counterparty should not commence until a credit
line has been approved.&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure of the credit-approval
process may differ among institutions, reflecting the
organizational and geographic structure of the institution and
the specific needs of its trading activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, in
all cases, it is important that credit limits be determined by
personnel who are independent of the trading function, that these
personnel use standards that are consistent with those used for
nontrading activities, and that counterparty credit lines are
consistent with the organization's policies and consolidated
exposures.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should consider the extent to which credit
limits are exceeded and whether exceptions were resolved
according to the bank's adopted policies and procedures.
Examiners should also evaluate whether the institution's reports
adequately provide traders and credit officers with relevant,
accurate, and timely information about the credit exposures and
approved credit lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trading activities that involve cash instruments often
involve short-term exposures that are eliminated at settlement.
However, in the case of derivative products traded in over-the-
counter markets, the exposure can often exist for a period
similar to that commonly associated with a bank loan.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this
potentially longer term exposure and the complexity associated
with some derivative instruments, banks should consider not only
the overall financial strength of the counterparty and its
ability to perform on its obligation, but should also consider
the counterparty's ability to understand and manage the risks
inherent in the derivative product.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Market Risk.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Market risk is the risk to a bank's
financial condition resulting from adverse movements in market
prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurately measuring a bank's market risk requires
timely information about the current market values of its assets,
liabilities, and off-balance sheet positions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are
many types of market risks that can affect a portfolio's value,
they can generally be described as those involving forward risk
and those involving options.&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward risks arise from factors
such as changing interest rates and currency exchange rates, the
liquidity of markets for specific commodities or financial
instruments, and local or world political and economic events.
Market risks related to options include these factors as well as
evolving perceptions of the volatility of price changes, the
passage of time, and the interactive effect of other market
risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these sources of potential market risk can affect
the value of the institution and should be considered in the risk
measurement process. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Market risk is increasingly measured by market
participants using a value-at-risk approach, which measures the
potential gain or loss in a position, portfolio, or institution
that is associated with a price movement of a given probability
over a specified time horizon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks should revalue all trading
portfolios and calculate their exposures at least daily .
Although banks may use risk measures other than value at risk,
examiners should consider whether the measure used is
sufficiently accurate and rigorous and whether it is adequately
incorporated into the bank's risk management process. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should also ensure that the institution
compares its estimated market risk exposures with actual market
price behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the output of any market risk
models that require simulations or forecasts of future prices
should be compared with actual prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the projected and
actual results differ materially, the models should be modified,
as appropriate.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Banks should establish limits for market risk that
relate to their risk measures and that are consistent with
maximum exposures authorized by their senior management and board
of directors.&nbsp;&nbsp;These limits should be allocated to business units
and individual traders and be clearly understood by all relevant
parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should ensure that exceptions to limits are
detected and adequately addressed by management.&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice,
some limit systems may include additional elements such as stop-loss limits and trading guidelines that may play an important
role in controlling risk at the trader and business unit level;
examiners should include them in their review of the limit
system.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Liquidity Risk.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks face two types of liquidity risk
in their trading activities:&nbsp;&nbsp;those related to specific products
or markets and those related to the general funding of the bank's
trading activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is the risk that a banking
institution cannot easily unwind or offset a particular position
at or near the previous market price because of inadequate market
depth or because of disruptions in the marketplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding
liquidity risk is the risk that the bank will be unable to meet
its payment obligations on settlement dates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since neither type
of liquidity risk is unique to trading activities, management
should evaluate these risks in the broader context of the
institution's overall liquidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;When establishing limits,
institutions should be aware of the size, depth and liquidity of
the particular market and establish trading guidelines
accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management should also give consideration to the
potential problems associated with replacing contracts that
terminate early in volatile or illiquid markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In developing guidelines for controlling the liquidity
risks in trading activities, banks should consider the
possibility that they could lose access to one or more markets,
either because of concerns about the bank's own creditworthiness,
the creditworthiness of a major counterparty, or because of
generally stressful market conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;At such times, the bank
may have less flexibility in managing its market, credit, and
liquidity risk exposures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks that make markets in over-the-counter derivatives or that dynamically hedge their positions
require constant access to financial markets, and that need may
increase in times of market stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bank's liquidity plan
should reflect the institution's ability to turn to alternative
markets, such as futures or cash markets, or to provide
sufficient collateral or other credit enhancements in order to
continue trading under a broad range of scenarios.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Examiners should ensure that banking institutions that
participate in over-the-counter derivative markets adequately
consider the potential liquidity risks associated with the early
termination of derivative contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many forms of standardized
contracts for derivative transactions allow counterparties to
request collateral or to terminate their contracts early if the
banking institution experiences an adverse credit event or a
deterioration in its financial condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, under
conditions of market stress, customers may ask for the early
termination of some contracts within the context of the dealer's
market making activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such situations, a bank that owes
money on derivative transactions may be required to deliver
collateral or settle a contract early and possibly at a time when
the bank may face other funding and liquidity pressures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Early
terminations may also open up additional, unintended, market
positions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management and directors should be aware of these
potential liquidity risks and should address them in the bank's
liquidity plan and in the broader context of the bank's liquidity
management process.&nbsp;&nbsp;In their reviews, examiners should consider
the extent to which such potential obligations could present
liquidity risks to the bank.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Operational Risk, Legal Risk and Business Practices.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Operating risk is the risk that deficiencies in information
systems or internal controls will result in unexpected loss.
Legal risk is the risk that contracts are not legally enforceable
or documented correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although operating and legal risks are
difficult to quantify, they can often be evaluated by examining a
series of plausible &quot;worst-case&quot; or &quot;what if&quot; scenarios, such as
a power loss, a doubling of transaction volume, a mistake found
in the pricing software for collateral management, or an
unenforceable contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;They can also be assessed through
periodic reviews of procedures, documentation requirements, data
processing systems, contingency plans, and other operating
practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such reviews may help to reduce the likelihood of
errors and breakdowns in controls, improve the control of risk
and the effectiveness of the limit system, and prevent unsound
marketing practices and the premature adoption of new products or
lines of business.&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the heavy reliance of trading
activities on computerized systems, banks should have plans that
take into account potential problems with their normal processing
procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Banks should also ensure that trades that are
consummated orally are confirmed as soon as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral
transactions conducted via telephone should be recorded on tape
and subsequently supported by written documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners
should ensure that the institution monitors the consistency
between the terms of a transaction as they were orally agreed-upon and the terms as they were subsequently confirmed.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should also consider the extent to which
banks evaluate and control operating risks through the use of
internal audits, stress testing, contingency planning, and other
managerial and analytical techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks should also have
approved policies that specify documentation requirements for
trading activities and formal procedures for saving and
safeguarding important documents that are consistent with legal
requirements and internal policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Relevant personnel should
fully understand the requirements.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal risks should be limited and managed through
policies developed by the institution's legal counsel (typically
in consultation with officers in the risk management process)
that have been approved by the bank's senior management and board
of directors.&nbsp;&nbsp;At a minimum, there should be guidelines and
processes in place to ensure the enforceability of counterparty
agreements.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should determine whether a bank is
adequately evaluating the enforceability of its agreements before
individual transactions are consummated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks should also
ensure that the counterparty has sufficient authority to enter
into the transaction and that the terms of the agreement are
legally sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks should further ascertain that their netting
agreements are adequately documented, that they have been
executed properly, and that they are enforceable in all relevant
jurisdictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks should have knowledge of relevant tax laws
and interpretations governing the use of these instruments.
Knowledge of these laws is necessary not only for the bank's
marketing activities, but also for its own use of derivative
products. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound business practices provide that banking
organizations take steps to ascertain the character and financial
sophistication of counterparties.&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes efforts to
ensure that the counterparties understand the nature of and the
risks inherent in the agreed transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the
counterparties are unsophisticated, either generally or with
respect to a particular type of transaction, banks should take
additional steps to ensure that counterparties are made aware of
the risks attendant in the specific type of transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;While
counterparties are ultimately responsible for the transactions
into which they choose to enter, where a bank recommends specific
transactions for an unsophisticated counterparty, the bank should
ensure that it has adequate information regarding its
counterparty on which to base its recommendation.<br>
<p>
 <b>III.</b>  <b>Internal Controls and Audits</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review of internal controls has long been central to
the Federal Reserve's examination of trading and derivatives
activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Policies and related procedures for the operation of
these activities should be an extension of the institution's
overall structure of internal controls and should be fully
integrated into routine work-flows.&nbsp;&nbsp;Properly structured, a
system of internal controls should promote effective and
efficient operations, reliable financial and regulatory
reporting, and compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and
bank policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether internal controls meet
those objectives, examiners should consider:&nbsp;&nbsp;the overall control
environment of the organization; the process for identifying,
analyzing and managing risk; the adequacy of management
information systems; and adherence to control activities such as
approvals, confirmations and reconciliations.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing the adequacy of internal controls involves a
process of understanding, documenting, evaluating and testing an
institution's internal control system.&nbsp;&nbsp;This assessment should
include product or business line reviews which, in turn, should
start with an assessment of the line's organizational structure.
Examiners should check for adequate separation of duties,
especially between trading desk personnel and internal control
and risk management functions, adequate oversight by a
knowledgeable manager without day-to-day trading
responsibilities, and the presence of separate reporting lines
for risk management and internal control personnel on one side
and for trading personnel on the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;Product-by-product
reviews of management structure should supplement the overall
assessment of the organizational structure of the trading and
derivatives areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Examiners are expected to conduct in-depth reviews of
the internal controls of key activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, for
transaction recording and processing, examiners should evaluate
written policies and procedures for recording trades, assess the
trading area's adherence to policy, and analyze the transaction
processing cycle, including settlement, to ensure the integrity
and accuracy of the bank's records and management reports.
Examiners should review the revaluation process in order to
assess the adequacy of written policies and procedures for
revaluing positions and for creating any associated revaluation
reserves.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should review compliance with revaluation
policies and procedures, the frequency of revaluation, and the
independence and quality of the sources of revaluation prices,
especially for instruments traded in illiquid markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;All
significant internal controls associated with the management of
market risk, such as position versus limit reports and limit
overage approval policies and procedures, should also be
reviewed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should also review the credit approval
process to ensure that the risks of specific products are
adequately captured and that credit approval procedures are
followed for all transactions.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An important step in the process of reviewing
internal controls is the examiner's appraisal of the frequency,
scope, and findings of independent internal and external auditors
and the ability of those auditors to review the bank's trading
and derivatives activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal auditors should audit and
test the risk management process and internal controls on a
periodic basis, with the frequency based on a careful risk assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The depth and frequency of internal audits should be
increased if weaknesses and significant issues are discovered or
if significant changes have been made to product lines, modelling
methodologies, the risk oversight process, internal controls, or
the overall risk profile of the institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reviewing the risk management functions in
particular, internal auditors should thoroughly evaluate the
effectiveness of internal controls relevant to measuring,
reporting and limiting risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal auditors should also
evaluate compliance with risk limits and the reliability and
timeliness of information reported to the bank's senior
management and board of directors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal auditors are also
expected to evaluate the independence and overall effectiveness
of the bank's risk management functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of confidence that examiners place in the
banking organization's audit programs, the nature of the audit
findings and management's response to those findings will
influence the scope of the current examination of trading and
derivatives activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when the audit process and findings
are satisfactory, examiners should document, evaluate and test
critical internal controls.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Similar to the focus of internal auditors, examiners
should pay special attention to significant changes in product
lines, risk measurement methodologies, limits, and internal
controls that have occurred since the last examination.
Meaningful changes in earnings from trading or derivatives
activities, or in the size of positions or the value at risk
associated with these activities, should also receive emphasis
during the examination. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For additional areas of testing and evaluation,
examiners should consult the Capital Markets and Trading
Activities Manual. If you have any questions regarding these
practices, please call Roger Cole, (202/452-2618), Jim Houpt
(202/452-3358), or Jim Embersit (202/452-5249).<br>
