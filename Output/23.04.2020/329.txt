effective June 27, 1995.&nbsp;&nbsp;The guidelines were drafted by an interagency working group

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interagency statement, which is being distributed with this SR Letter,
is consistent with current Board policy regarding the acceptance and reliance on
independent State reports of examination in lieu of Federal Reserve examinations.
Currently, the Federal banking agencies, individually, have entered into formal or
informal arrangements or working agreements with most State Banking departments.
The new interagency guidelines maintain the flexibility of these arrangements or
working agreements and provide criteria, to be considered in whole or in part, by a
Federal banking agency when determining the acceptability of an independent  State
report of examination.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserve Banks should review this statement and ensure that their
procedures for reliance on independent State examinations are consistent with this
statement and current Board policy.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any questions regarding this policy statement should be directed to

<Font Size=+1><b>PRESS RELEASE</Font></b><br>
<p>
For immediate release&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  June 22, 1995<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) announced
today its adoption of Guidelines for Relying on State Examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The guidelines
were issued pursuant to section 349 of the Riegle Community Development and
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 and will be effective upon publication in the
<I>Federal Register</I>.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 349 requires the FFIEC to issue guidelines establishing standards for
the purpose of determining the acceptability of State reports of examination under
section 10(d) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;The guidelines describe the
current working relationships with the States and sets forth general criteria for
determining the acceptability of State reports.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 349 states that the standards
are to be used at the discretion of the appropriate Federal banking agency.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guidelines were drafted by an interagency working group consisting of

Guidelines for Relying on State Examinations<br>
<p>
<b>Agency:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council<br>
<p>
<b>ACTION</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice and Final Guidelines.<br>
<p>
<b>SUMMARY:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)
announces the adoption of its Guidelines for Relying on State Examinations pursuant
to section 349 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement
Act of 1994 (CDRI Act), codified at 12 U.S.C. 1820(d)(9).&nbsp;&nbsp;This section requires the
FFIEC to issue guidelines establishing standards for the purpose of determining the
acceptability of State reports of examination under section 10(d)(3) of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), 12 U.S.C. 1820(d)(3).&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 10(d)(3), a
Federal banking agency may conduct an annual, on-site examination of an insured
depository institution in alternate 12-month periods (except those insured institutions
with total assets of less than $250 million for which an 18-month examination cycle is
permitted) if the Federal banking agency determines that a State examination of that
institution conducted during the intervening period is adequate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 349 of the
CDRI Act states that the standards issued by the FFIEC are to be used at the
discretion of the appropriate Federal banking agency.<br>
<p>
<b>EFFECTIVE DATE:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;These guidelines are effective on  <b>[Insert date of publication in
the <I>Federal Register</I></b><b>]</b><b>.</b><br>

<p>
<b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisory divisions of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and
the Office of Thrift Supervision (Federal banking agencies) responsible for the
examination of state-chartered, insured depository institutions, and the branches and
agencies of foreign banks that have been chartered by the States have a long history
of coordinating with the State banking departments<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></a> in fulfilling a mutual goal of
promoting a safe and sound banking system.<a href="#Footnote2" title="Footnote 2" name="Footref2"><SUP>2</SUP></a>  It is recognized that this close
cooperation between the Federal and State regulators promotes efficiency in the
examination process, reduces the regulatory burden on state-chartered, insured
depository institutions, and improves the supervisory process.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal and State banking agencies have worked together, to varying
degrees, in the following areas:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Conducting alternate, joint and concurrent safety and soundness
examinations of insured depository institutions and of the branches and
agencies of foreign banks that have been chartered by the States. <br>
<p>
<li>Processing safety and soundness examination reports and applications on
a timely basis. <br>
<p>
<li>Using common examination report and application forms. <br>
<p>
<li>Developing and issuing informal (e.g., board resolutions, memoranda of
understanding or other similar agreements) and formal enforcement actions. <br>
<p>
<li>Exchanging supervisory information. <br>
<p>
<li>Offering Federal agency training programs to State Examiners. <br>
<p>
<li>Providing access to the Federal agency data bases. <br>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal banking agencies intend to continue these cooperative efforts to
the maximum extent possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized, however, that the adequacy of State
budgeting, examiner staffing, and training are important factors to enhancing Federal
and State coordination.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Federal banking agencies, individually, have
entered into formal or informal arrangements or working agreements with most State
banking departments.&nbsp;&nbsp;These working agreements or informal arrangements generally
address the following areas:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The number of state-chartered, insured institutions to be examined on an
alternating basis by the State banking department and by the Federal banking
agency. <br>
<p>
<li>The frequency of safety and soundness examinations. <br>
<p>
<li>The type of examinations to be conducted (independent, joint, or
concurrent) by each agency. <br>
<p>
<li>The pre-examination procedures to be performed. <br>
<p>
<li>The responsibilities of each agency for processing reports of examination. <br>
<p>
<li>The responsibilities of each agency for conducting specialty examinations
(compliance, information systems, trust, etc.). <br>
<p>
<li>The procedures for coordinating informal and formal enforcement actions. <br>
<p>
<li>The procedures for processing joint applications. <br>
<p>
<li>The procedures for sharing supervisory information. <br>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These working agreements or informal arrangements are structured to permit
both Federal and State agencies the flexibility to conduct an independent examination
subject only to notification to the other party.&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, only institutions rated &quot;1&quot; or
&quot;2&quot; are examined on an alternating basis allowing for a reasonable interval between
examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriate Federal banking agency and the State banking
department periodically meet and coordinate examination schedules.<a href="#Footnote3" title="Footnote 3" name="Footref3"><SUP>3</SUP></a> <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A hallmark of the successful program to date has been this flexibility to tailor
cooperation to the particulars of each State and to the specifics of individual banks
within a State, plus the reality of changing circumstances at both the Federal and the
State levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;The FFIEC guidelines strive to maintain that flexibility.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Therefore, the FFIEC issues the following guidelines pursuant to  12 U.S.C.
1820(d)(9): <br>
<p>
<b>GUIDELINES FOR RELYING ON STATE EXAMINATIONS:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal banking
agencies will accept and rely on State reports of examination in all cases in which it is
determined that State examinations enable the Federal banking agencies to effectively
carry out their supervisory responsibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following criteria may be considered,
in whole or in part, by a Federal banking agency when determining the acceptability of
a State report of examination under section 10(d) of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The completeness of the State examination report.&nbsp;&nbsp;The State report of
examination of a state-chartered, insured depository institution or a state-chartered branch or agency of a foreign bank should contain sufficient
information to permit a reviewer to make an independent determination on the
overall condition of the institution as well as each component factor and
composite rating assigned under the &quot;Uniform Financial Institutions Rating
System&quot; used for insured depository institutions and commonly referred to as
the &quot;CAMEL&quot; rating system or the ROCA rating system used for branches and
agencies of foreign banks. <br>
<p>
<li>The adequacy of documentation maintained routinely by State examiners to
support observations made in examination reports. <br>
<p>
<li>The ability over time of a State banking department to achieve examination
objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;At a minimum, the Federal banking agencies will consider the
adequacy of State budgeting, examiner staffing and training, and the overall
review and follow-up examination process of a State banking department.
Accreditation of a State banking department by the Conference of State Bank
Supervisors is among the factors that also will be considered. <br>
<p>
<li>The adequacy of any formal or informal arrangement or working agreement
between a State banking department and a Federal banking agency. <br>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal banking agencies, as part of their routine review of State
examination reports, will assess the quality and scope of the reports to determine
whether they continue to meet the above general criteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal banking
agencies retain the option in cases in which a State examination report appears
insufficient or the condition of an insured institution, as indicated in the examination
report or other sources, appears to be seriously deteriorating, to conduct a follow-up
examination.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriate Federal banking agency and State banking department will
continue to share, discuss and work to resolve any problems or concerns regarding
the acceptability of each other's work or the operation of these guidelines and the
alternating examination program, as well as other issues of mutual interest.<br>
