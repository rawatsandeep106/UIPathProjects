<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Recently, some merger and acquisition applications filed with the Federal 
   Reserve have included broad scope indemnification clauses in the agreements 
   between the parties to the proposed transactions.&nbsp; Some of these 
   indemnification clauses seek to indemnify the target financial institution's 
   officers, directors, and employees from any judgments, fines, claims or 
   settlements whether civil, criminal, or administrative that relate to 
   &quot;conduct before the merger or acquisition.&quot;  Some state member 
   banks and bank holding companies have also adopted broadly worded 
   indemnification provisions in their by-laws or entered into separate 
   indemnification agreements that cover the on-going activities of their own 
   institution-affiliated parties.<A HREF="#Footnote1" 
   name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>&nbsp; Federal Reserve staff has found that 
   many of the indemnification provisions are inconsistent with federal 
   banking law and regulations, as well as safe and sound banking practices, 
   and has advised applicants and supervised institutions about the 
   deficiencies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The purpose of this letter is to remind Reserve Bank examination and 
   applications staff, and state member banks and bank holding companies of 
   the limitations on indemnification imposed by section&nbsp;18(k) of the 
   Federal Deposit Insurance&nbsp;Act, which was added by the Crime 
   Control&nbsp;Act of&nbsp;1990, and the regulations issued thereunder by 
   the FDIC.&nbsp; The law and regulations apply to indemnification agreements 
   and payments made by any bank or bank holding company to any 
   institution-affiliated party, regardless of the condition of the financial 
   institution.&nbsp; The purposes of the law and regulations are to 
   preserve the deterrent effects of administrative enforcement actions by 
   ensuring that individuals subject to final enforcement actions bear the 
   costs of any judgments, fines, and associated legal expenses, and to 
   safeguard the assets of financial institutions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The FDIC's regulations define a &quot;prohibited indemnification 
   payment&quot; to include any payment or agreement to make a payment by a 
   bank or a bank holding company to an institution-affiliated party to pay or 
   reimburse such person for any liability or legal expense in any 
   administrative proceeding brought by the appropriate federal banking 
   agency that results in a final order or settlement in which the 
   institution-affiliated party is assessed a civil money penalty, is removed 
   or prohibited from banking, or is required to cease an action or take 
   any affirmative action, including making restitution, with respect to the 
   bank or bank holding company.<A HREF="#Footnote2" 
   name="Footref2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>&nbsp; Under the FDIC's regulations, a 
   bank or bank holding company may make a reasonable payment to purchase 
   commercial insurance to cover certain costs that the institution incurs 
   under an indemnification agreement.&nbsp; Costs that may be covered by 
   insurance include legal expenses and restitution that an individual may be 
   ordered to make to the institution or receiver.&nbsp; The insurance may 
   not, however, pay or reimburse an institution-affiliated party for any 
   final judgment or civil money penalty assessed against such 
   individual.&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The FDIC's regulations provide criteria for making permissible 
   indemnification payments.&nbsp; A bank or a bank holding company may make 
   or agree to make a reasonable indemnification payment if <U>all</U> of the 
   following conditions are met: (i)&nbsp;the institution's board of 
   directors determines in writing that the institution-affiliated party 
   acted in good faith and the best interests of the institution; 
   (ii)&nbsp;the board of directors determines that the payment will not 
   materially affect the institution's safety and soundness; (iii)&nbsp;the 
   payment does not fall within the definition of a prohibited indemnification 
   payment; and (iv)&nbsp;the institution-affiliated party agrees in writing 
   to reimburse the institution, to the extent not covered by permissible 
   insurance, for payments made in the event that the administrative action 
   results in a final order or settlement in which the institution-affiliated 
   party is assessed a civil money penalty, is removed or prohibited from 
   banking, or is required, under a final order, to cease an action or take 
   any affirmative action.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The law and FDIC's regulations, which apply to all state member banks and 
   bank holding companies, reinforce the Federal Reserve's longstanding policy 
   that an institution-affiliated party who engages in misconduct should not 
   be insulated from the consequences of his or her misconduct.&nbsp; From a 
   safety and soundness perspective, a state member bank or bank holding 
   company should not divert its assets to pay a fine or other final judgment 
   issued against an institution-affiliated party for misconduct that 
   presumably violates the institution's policy of compliance with 
   applicable&nbsp;law, especially in cases where the individual's misconduct 
   has already harmed the institution.&nbsp; Although state corporate laws may 
   allow a company to adopt  by-laws indemnifying its institution-affiliated 
   parties, any indemnification provisions or agreements adopted by a state 
   member bank or bank holding company must comply with federal law and the 
   FDIC's regulations concerning indemnification.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   In addition, bank holding companies that issue securities to the public 
   under a prospectus declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
   Commission should note that the SEC's 
   Regulation&nbsp;S-K&nbsp;(17&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;229.512) requires that the 
   prospectus include the following statement:&nbsp; <I>Insofar as 
   indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities&nbsp;Act 
   of&nbsp;1933 may be permitted to directors, officers, or persons 
   controlling the registrant, the registrant has been informed that in 
   the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as 
   expressed in the&nbsp;Act and is therefore unenforceable.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   State member banks and bank holding companies should review their 
   by-laws and any outstanding indemnification agreements, as well as 
   insurance policies, to ensure that they conform with the requirements of 
   federal law and regulations.&nbsp; In the event that a state member bank 
   or bank holding company fails to take appropriate action to bring its 
   indemnification provisions into compliance with federal laws and 
   regulations, appropriate follow-up supervisory action may be 
   taken.&nbsp; Applications involving banks or bank holding companies 
   with indemnification-related issues identified in the supervisory process 
   will be reviewed by Federal Reserve staff for compliance with federal 
   law and regulations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this letter to all state member 
   banks and bank holding companies in their districts, as well as their 
   examination and applications staff.&nbsp; Should you have any questions 
   regarding this matter, please contact Nancy&nbsp;Oakes, Counsel, 
   Division of Banking Supervisions and Regulation, at (202)&nbsp;452-2743.</P>
