<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Application Filing Information Web Page</div>
<p>Board staff has developed an online resource for 
   banking organizations and others interested in how 
   to submit banking applications to the Federal Reserve. 
   The new Application Filing Information Web Page is 
   located on the Board's public web site at <a href="/generalinfo/applications/afi/">www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/applications/afi/</a>.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>The new web page provides general guidance with respect 
   to the regulatory requirements and processing standards 
   relating to applications submitted to the Federal 
   Reserve by U.S. or foreign banking organizations. 
   It describes the statutory factors considered by 
   the Federal Reserve in evaluating an application, 
   including the banking organization's record of compliance 
   with the Community Reinvestment Act. Specific types 
   of applications submitted to the Federal Reserve 
   are described, as well as related newspaper publication 
   instructions and processing timeframes. The web page 
   also provides links to application forms. In addition, 
   it identifies contacts at each Reserve Bank to whom 
   questions or comments can be directed. </p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this SR&nbsp;letter 
   to their applications and examination staffs, and 
   to the domestic and foreign banking organizations 
   in their districts. Should you have any questions 
   regarding the new web site, please contact Michael&nbsp;Sexton, 
   Supervisory Financial Analyst, Division of Banking 
   Supervision and Regulation, at (202)&nbsp;452-3009.</p>
