<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Guidance Regarding 
   Restrictions on Institutions in Troubled Condition</div>
<p>Recently, it has come to the attention of the staff 
   of the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation 
   that some state member banks and bank holding companies 
   that are in less than satisfactory condition may 
   not be aware of certain statutory restrictions on 
   severance payments made to their institution-affiliated 
   parties, which are referred to as &quot;golden parachute&quot; 
   payments, and requirements regarding the appointment 
   of new directors or senior executive officers that 
   may apply to such institutions.<a href="#Footnote1" 
   name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
   The purpose of this SR&nbsp;letter is to remind Reserve&nbsp;Bank 
   examination and applications staff about these restrictions 
   and to ensure that banking organizations subject 
   to the restrictions are fully aware of them and have 
   monitoring programs in place to ensure compliance 
   with the statutory requirements regarding certain 
   payments and appointments.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Troubled Condition</div>
<p>For Federal Reserve supervisory purposes, the restrictions 
   described in this SR&nbsp;letter apply only to state 
   member banks and bank holding companies that are 
   in &quot;troubled condition.&quot; Section&nbsp;225.71 
   of Regulation&nbsp;Y defines a &quot;troubled condition&quot; 
   for a state member bank or bank holding company as 
   an institution that (i)&nbsp;has a composite rating 
   of 4&nbsp;or&nbsp;5; (ii)&nbsp;is subject to a cease 
   and desist order or formal written agreement that 
   requires action to improve the institution's financial 
   condition, unless otherwise informed in writing by 
   the Federal&nbsp;Reserve; or (iii)&nbsp;is informed 
   in writing by the Federal&nbsp;Reserve that it is 
   in a troubled condition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except in some limited circumstances, cease and desist 
   orders or written agreements issued by the Federal&nbsp;Reserve 
   are aimed at improving the financial condition of 
   the banking organization subject to the action. Therefore, 
   most state member banks and bank holding companies 
   subject to a formal enforcement action need to comply 
   with the restrictions placed on troubled institutions 
   by the federal laws and regulations that are described 
   below.<a href="#Footnote2" 
   name="Footref2" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp; 
</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Golden Parachute Payments</div>
<p>&quot;Golden parachute&quot; payment restrictions 
   were enacted as part of the Crime&nbsp;Control&nbsp;Act 
   of&nbsp;1990.<a href="#Footnote3" 
   name="Footref3" title="Footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
   The law added section&nbsp;18(k) to the Federal Deposit 
   Insurance Act&nbsp;(12&nbsp;U.S.C.&nbsp;1828(k)) 
   and authorized the FDIC to issue implementing regulations. 
   The FDIC's golden parachute regulations may apply 
   to an insured depository institution or its holding 
   company if the institution or company is in a &quot;troubled 
   condition&quot; as defined in Regulation&nbsp;Y. 
   The purposes of the law and regulations include safeguarding 
   the assets of financial institutions and limiting 
   rewards to institution-affiliated parties who may 
   have contributed to the institution's condition.</p>
<p>In general, the FDIC's regulations prohibit insured 
   depository institutions and their holding companies 
   from making &quot;golden parachute&quot; payments 
   except in certain circumstances.<a href="#Footnote4" 
   name="Footref4" title="Footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
   Under the FDIC's regulations, a &quot;golden parachute&quot; 
   payment means any payment in the nature of compensation 
   (or agreement to make such a payment) for the benefit 
   of any current or former institution-affiliated party 
   of an insured depository institution or its holding 
   company that meets three criteria. First, the payment 
   or agreement must be contingent upon the termination 
   of the institution-affiliated party's employment 
   or association. Second, the payment or agreement 
   is received on or after, or made in contemplation 
   of, among other things, a determination that the 
   institution or holding company is in a &quot;troubled 
   condition&quot; under the regulations of the applicable 
   banking agency. Third, the payment or agreement must 
   be payable to an institution-affiliated party who 
   is terminated when the institution or holding company 
   meets certain specific conditions, including being 
   subject to a determination that it is in a troubled 
   condition.</p>
<p>The definition of a &quot;golden parachute&quot; 
   payment also covers a payment made by a bank holding 
   company that is not in a troubled condition to an 
   institution-affiliated party of an insured depository 
   institution subsidiary that is in a troubled condition, 
   if the other criteria in the definition are met. 
   This circumstance may arise when a bank holding company, 
   as part of an agreement to acquire a troubled bank 
   or savings association, proposes to make payments 
   to the troubled institution's institution-affiliated 
   parties that are conditioned on their termination 
   of employment.<a href="#Footnote5" 
   name="Footref5" title="Footnote 5"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A state member bank or bank holding company may make 
   or enter into an agreement to make a golden parachute 
   payment only:&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;if the Federal&nbsp;Reserve, 
   with the written concurrence of the FDIC, determines 
   that the payment or agreement is permissible; (ii)&nbsp;as 
   part of an agreement to hire competent management 
   in certain conditions, with the consent of the Federal&nbsp;Reserve 
   and the FDIC as to the amount and terms of the proposed 
   payment; or (iii)&nbsp;pursuant to an agreement to 
   provide a reasonable severance not to exceed twelve 
   months' salary in the event of an unassisted change 
   in control of the depository institution, with the 
   consent of the Federal&nbsp;Reserve. In determining 
   permissibility of the payment, the Federal&nbsp;Reserve 
   may consider a variety of factors, including the 
   individual's degree of managerial responsibilities, 
   length of service, the reasonableness of the payment, 
   and any other factors or circumstances that would 
   indicate that the proposed payment would be contrary 
   to the purposes of the statute or regulations.</p>
<p>A state member bank or bank holding company requesting 
   approval to make a golden parachute payment or enter 
   into an agreement to make such a payment should submit 
   its request simultaneously to the appropriate FDIC 
   regional office and Reserve&nbsp;Bank. The request 
   must detail the proposed payments and demonstrate 
   that the state member bank or bank holding company 
   does not possess and is not aware of any evidence 
   that there is reasonable basis to believe, at the 
   time that the payment is proposed to be made, that 
   the institution-affiliated party receiving such a 
   payment has committed any fraud, breach of fiduciary 
   duty, insider abuse, or materially violated any applicable 
   banking law or regulation that had or is likely to 
   have a material adverse affect on the bank or company, 
   that the individual is substantially responsible 
   for the institution's insolvency or troubled condition, 
   and has violated specified banking or criminal laws. 
</p>
<p>In the event that a state member bank or bank holding 
   company makes or enters into an agreement to make 
   a golden parachute payment without prior regulatory 
   approval when required, appropriate follow-up supervisory 
   action should be taken. This could include an enforcement 
   action requiring the offending institution-affiliated 
   party to reimburse the institution for the amount 
   of the prohibited payment. Applications involving 
   state member banks or bank holding companies with 
   golden parachute-related issues identified in the 
   supervisory process should be carefully reviewed 
   by appropriate Reserve&nbsp;Bank and Board applications 
   and supervisory staff for compliance with the law 
   and the FDIC's regulations. </p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Appointment of Directors and Senior Executive 
   Officers</div>
<p>Under section&nbsp;32 of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
   Act&nbsp;(12&nbsp;U.S.C.&nbsp;1831i) and Subpart&nbsp;H 
   of Regulation&nbsp;Y (12&nbsp;C.F.R.&nbsp;225.71&nbsp;<i>et&nbsp;seq.</i>), 
   any state member bank or bank holding company that 
   is in a troubled condition or does not meet minimum 
   capital standards must provide 30&nbsp;days' written 
   notice to the Board of Governors prior to appointing 
   any new director or senior executive officer.<a href="#Footnote6" 
   name="Footref6" title="Footnote 6"><sup>6</sup></a> 
   This requirement also applies to any change in the 
   responsibilities of any current senior executive 
   officer who is proposing to assume a different senior 
   officer position. Subpart&nbsp;H of Regulation&nbsp;Y 
   details the procedures for filing and the content 
   of the notice. The Board may disapprove a notice 
   if it finds that the competence, experience, character, 
   or integrity of the proposed individual indicates 
   that such service would not be in the best interest 
   of the institution's depositors or the public. A 
   disapproved individual or the institution that filed 
   the notice may appeal the Federal&nbsp;Reserve's 
   notice of disapproval under the procedures detailed 
   in Regulation&nbsp;Y. The individual may not serve 
   as a director or senior executive officer while the 
   appeal is pending.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event that a state member bank or bank holding 
   company that is in a troubled condition appoints 
   a director or senior officer without the required 
   30&nbsp;days' prior written notice, appropriate follow-up 
   supervisory action should be taken.</p>
<p>Reserve&nbsp;Banks are asked to distribute this SR&nbsp;letter 
   to their examination and applications staff, and 
   to state member banks and bank holding companies 
   in their Districts to remind the institutions about 
   the restrictions imposed by federal law and regulations 
   on &quot;troubled institutions&quot; regarding severance 
   payments and new director and senior executive officer 
   appointments. </p>
<p>Should you have any questions regarding this matter, 
   please contact Nancy&nbsp;Oakes, Counsel, Division 
   of Banking Supervisions and Regulation, at (202)&nbsp;452-2743, 
   or Richard&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Ashton, Associate General
