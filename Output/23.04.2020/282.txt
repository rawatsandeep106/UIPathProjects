&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last several months, the Federal Reserve staff
has participated in discussions among countries that have adopted
the Basle risk-based capital framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of these
ongoing discussions is to review questions relating to the
implementation of the Accord and to facilitate a broadly
consistent approach to implementation of the framework
internationally.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attached staff memorandum sets forth a summary of
some of the issues that have been raised on the subjects of loan
commitments and put options which function like financial
guarantees.&nbsp;&nbsp;The memorandum also describes the consensus that has
been reached by supervisors from the G-10 countries on these
issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;The guidance contained in the memorandum is intended to
clarify how the Accord is to be implemented; it does not amend the
framework or alter its basic structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b><center>Federal Reserve Staff Memorandum<br>
on Questions and Interpretations Relating to the<br>
Implementation of the Risk-Based Capital Framework</center></b>
<p>
<br>
<p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following guidelines and interpretations are
provided to facilitate implementation of the risk-based capital
framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;The clarifications and explanatory information set
forth below represent a broad consensus view of supervisors from
the G-10 countries which have adopted the risk-based capital
framework, and have been endorsed by the Basle Supervisors'
Committee.
<p>
<b>Conversion Factors of Off-Balance Sheet Items</b>
<p>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Commitments
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Federal
Reserve, in keeping with the Basle Accord, generally require that
long-term commitments (those with an original maturity over one
year) be subject to a 50 percent conversion factor, and that
short-term commitments (those with an original maturity of one
year or less) be converted at zero percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing the
risk-based capital framework, it was recognized that a maturity
break for the credit conversion factors of loan commitments might
create an incentive for banks to structure their commitments in
such a manner as to avoid a capital requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;This outcome was
considered acceptable provided it led banks to genuinely reduce
the duration of their commitments, and thus their potential credit
risk, to a maximum of one year from the date on which the
commitments were made.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the industry has responded to the
incentive to structure commitments on a short-term basis, some
questions have been raised concerning 1) the meaning of original
maturity and 2) when a commitment must be unconditionally
cancelable in order to be eligible for the zero percent conversion
factor.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Basle Accord states that &quot;commitments with an
original maturity of up to one year, or which can be
unconditionally canceled <I>at any time</I>&quot; (emphasis added) are
eligible for the zero percent conversion factor.&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of
determining term to maturity, the Federal Reserve's guidelines
define original maturity as, &quot;the length of time between the date
the commitment is issued and the earliest date on which (1) the
banking organization can, at its option, unconditionally (without
cause) cancel the commitment and (2) the banking organization is
scheduled to (and as a normal practice actually does) review the
facility to determine whether or not it should be extended.&quot;
Thus, a long-term facility with a nominal maturity of over one
year could be converted at zero percent, if, within the first year
of the commitment, the bank performs a credit review and at that
point can unconditionally cancel the commitment without cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
other words, after the first year the commitment must be
unconditionally cancelable on each and every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition,
credit reviews must be conducted at least annually for such
facilities to qualify as short-term commitments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Commitments
meeting these criteria may be considered to have an original
maturity of one year or less for risk-based capital purposes.
However, in the cases of commitments nominally meeting the
&quot;criteria&quot; for conversion at zero percent but which are in
substance long-term facilities, examiners have the right to
classify such commitments as long-term.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, commitments expire in one of two ways:&nbsp;&nbsp;1)
all funds are drawn, and the outstanding commitment is reduced to
zero when the resulting loan is booked; or 2) the commitment can
reach its stated maturity, in which case it ceases to be binding
on either party.&nbsp;&nbsp;A commitment that is structured in such a way
that it must expire from either of these two causes within one
year is clearly entitled to the zero percent conversion factor.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Any commitment which does not expire within one year is subject to
the 50 percent conversion factor, unless, as set forth in the
Federal Reserve's guidelines, the issuing bank has full and
unconditional discretion within a year to withdraw the commitment
at any time and conducts a formal review of the commitment,
including an assessment of the credit quality of the obligor, at
least annually beginning within one year of the date of issuing
the commitment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this credit review is to give the
issuing bank the opportunity to take note of any deterioration in
the credit quality of the obligor, thereby enabling it to exercise
its right to immediately and unconditionally,  i.e., without
notice to the customer, revoke the commitment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, so-called
evergreen commitments, which require that the bank give advance
notice of cancellation to the obligor or which permit the
commitment to roll over automatically unless the bank gives notice
of its intention not to permit such a rollover, are not
unconditionally cancelable and are subject to the 50 percent
conversion factor.&nbsp;&nbsp;A commitment that will expire irrevocably
within one year is the only exception to this treatment and is
converted at zero percent.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some commitments are entered into with the understanding
that the issuing bank will renew the commitment within one year
subject to a thorough credit review of the obligor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Commitments
of this type, so long as they expire within one year, may be
accorded a zero percent risk-weight, only if:&nbsp;&nbsp;1) the
renegotiation process is carried out in good faith, involves a
full credit assessment of the obligor, and permits the bank the
flexibility to alter the terms and conditions of the commitment;
2) the bank has absolute discretion to renew and extend the
commitment or to decline to do so; and 3) the renegotiated
commitment expires within 12 months from the time it is made.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as a commitment expires within one year, the
maturity of any extension of credit made under it is irrelevant to
determining the appropriate conversion factor for the commitment,
e.g.,a 90-day commitment to make a 30-year real estate loan would
be converted at the zero percent conversion factor.&nbsp;&nbsp;The loan, of
course, if made, would then be assigned the risk weight
appropriate to the obligor, collateral, or guarantor.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A forward commitment is a commitment where, in effect,
the bank commits to issue a commitment at a future date.&nbsp;&nbsp;For
example, the bank may commit to a customer that, at the end of two
years, it will give that customer a firm commitment for a period
of ten months.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a forward commitment should be viewed as a
commitment from inception with a maturity of two years and ten
months and, accordingly, would be subject to the 50 percent
conversion factor for risk-based capital purposes.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes banks issue commitments which can be drawn
down in a number of tranches.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these tranches may be
exercisable within one year while others may be exercisable over
longer periods.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such transactions, the full amount of the
undrawn commitment would be subject to the 50 percent conversion
factor, i.e., the entire commitment would be treated as having a
maturity of over one year.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, long-term commitments permit the borrower
to draw down different amounts at different times, perhaps
reflecting the seasonal credit needs of the borrower.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
transactions of this type, the appropriate conversion factor
should be applied to the maximum amount that can be drawn under
the commitment.
<p>
<p>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Off-Balance Sheet Instruments
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under certain circumstances, options can be the
functional equivalent of direct credit substitutes. Thus, it is
appropriate that written put options on specified assets, which
have the character of a credit enhancement, i.e., function as a
direct credit substitute, be subject to the same 100 percent
conversion factor that generally applies to financial guarantees.
In addition, these instruments should be assigned a risk weight
according to the underlying asset and not the purchaser of the
option.&nbsp;&nbsp;In effect, the risk weight should be the same as if the
bank had entered directly into the underlying transaction.
