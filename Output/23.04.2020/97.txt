<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Federal Reserve staff has become aware that in recent weeks bank holding companies 
   seeking to hedge the interest rate risk on their issues of trust preferred stock have 
   been offered derivative contracts with terms that have the effect of contravening the 
   strict conditions for the inclusion of the trust preferred stock in tier&nbsp;1 
   capital.<A HREF="#Footnote1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>&nbsp; The terms in 
   question take effect when the bank holding company defers dividend payments on the 
   trust preferred stock subject to the hedge.&nbsp; When such a deferral event occurs, 
   the contracts provide that the derivative counterparty will defer on a cumulative basis 
   its swap payments due to the banking organization while the bank holding company 
   continues to make payments to the derivative counterparty.&nbsp; The Federal Reserve 
   has supervisory concerns where the contract terms for deferral on swap payments are not 
   symmetrical and require the banking organization to make payments to the swap 
   counterparty without receiving payments from the counterparty.&nbsp; Contracts 
   structured in this manner undermine the loss-absorbing capacity of the hedged trust 
   preferred stock and, consequently, its eligibility for Tier&nbsp;1 capital.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   In order for trust preferred stock to be included in Tier&nbsp;1 capital, the issuing 
   bank holding company must have the ability to defer payments for at least twenty 
   consecutive quarters without giving rise to an event of default.&nbsp; Such a 
   deferral feature, which typically is cumulative in trust preferred stock, is essential 
   in a Tier&nbsp;1 instrument because it allows the issuer to conserve its cash resources 
   at a time when its financial condition is deteriorating.&nbsp; Where an issue of trust 
   preferred stock is hedged by a swap with asymmetrical deferral terms as described 
   above, however, the cash resources conserved through deferral would be paid out to the 
   swap counterparty.&nbsp; This outflow of cash would not be offset by receipt of 
   payments in from the counterparty.&nbsp; Thus, such a contract defeats the 
   cash-conserving purpose of the deferral mechanism on the trust preferred stock and 
   undermines the instrument's loss-absorbing capacity.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Trust preferred stock issues that are covered by an interest rate derivative contract 
   with asymmetrical terms such as those described above are not includable in 
   Tier&nbsp;1 capital.&nbsp; When a banking organization hedges trust preferred stock 
   through an interest rate swap with a deferral feature, the deferral terms on the swap 
   must be symmetrical for both the organization and its counterparty and must not have 
   the effect of draining the organization's resources in a time of stress.&nbsp; A 
   &quot;plain vanilla&quot; swap where neither the banking organization nor its 
   counterparty may defer payments generally is an acceptable instrument for hedging the 
   interest rate risk on trust preferred stock included in Tier&nbsp;1.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Reserve Banks are asked to forward this SR&nbsp;letter to banking organizations 
   subject to Federal Reserve supervision.&nbsp; Any banking organization that has hedged 
   trust preferred stock with an interest rate derivative contract that is asymmetrical 
   with regard to deferral terms should immediately contact its Reserve Bank.&nbsp; Any 
   questions on this SR&nbsp;letter may be directed to Norah&nbsp;Barger, Deputy Associate 
   Director, at (202)&nbsp;452-2402, or John&nbsp;Connolly, Supervisory Financial 
   Analyst, at (202)&nbsp;452-3621.</P>

   The conditions set forth in the Boardâ€™s October&nbsp;21, 1996 release authorizing the 
   inclusion of trust preferred stock in tier&nbsp;1 capital include a condition that 
   distributions to investors in trust preferred stock be deferrable for a minimum 
   five-year deferral period.&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
