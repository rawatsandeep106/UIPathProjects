&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this letter is to supplement the guidance
regarding the conduct of bank holding company inspections outlined
in SR 85-28, effective January 1, 1986, as it relates to the
supervision of nonbank subsidiaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, this letter
establishes 1) the requirement for a written risk assessment of all
nonbank activities of bank holding companies, 2) criteria for
required on-site inspections of nonbank subsidiaries, and 3)
standards for off-site review of nonbank activities.<br>
<p>
<b>Risk Assessment of Nonbank Activities<br></b>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each bank holding company with nonbank activities,
examiners should prepare a written &quot;risk assessment&quot; of each active
nonbank subsidiary addressing the financial and managerial concerns
outlined below.<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></a>  This assessment should be performed with the same
frequency required for full scope inspections.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this
assessment is to identify subsidiaries with a risk profile that
warrants an on-site presence, even if the subsidiary does not meet
the minimum criteria set forth below under the section &quot;On-site
Reviews of Nonbank Subsidiaries.&quot;  In formulating this assessment,
the examiner should consider all available sources of information
including, but not limited to: <br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>findings, scope and recency of previous inspections; <br>
<li>ongoing monitoring efforts of surveillance and financial
analysis units; <br>
<li>information received through first day letters or other
pre-inspection communications; <br>
<li>regulatory reports and published financial information;
and, <br>
<li>reports of internal and external auditors. <br>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk assessment should address each nonbank
subsidiary's funding risk, earnings exposure, operational risks,
asset quality, capital adequacy, contingent liabilities and other
off-balance sheet exposures, management information systems and
controls, transactions with affiliates, growth in assets, and the
quality of oversight provided by the management of the bank holding
company and nonbank subsidiary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners are expected to document
their assessment of the overall risk posed by each nonbank
subsidiary in the inspection workpapers and to summarize their
assessment of nonbank activities in bank holding company inspection
reports.<br>
<p>
<b>On-Site Reviews of Nonbank Subsidiaries</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the risk assessment performed for all
nonbank activities, an on-site review is required for the following
nonbank subsidiaries<a href="#Footnote2" title="Footnote 2" name="Footref2"><SUP>2</SUP></a>:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Any individual subsidiary that meets either of the
following two significance criteria or that is otherwise
deemed by the Reserve Bank to have a significant impact
on the bank holding company's condition or performance:</b><a href="#Footnote3" title="Footnote 3" name="Footref3"><SUP>3</SUP></a> <br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The subsidiary has total assets which equal 10
percent or more of the bank holding company's
consolidated Tier 1 capital;  or <br>
<p>
<li>The subsidiary's total operating revenue equals 10
percent or more of the bank holding company's
consolidated total operating revenue.<a href="#Footnote4" title="Footnote 4" name="Footref4"><SUP>4</SUP></a> <br>
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Nonbank subsidiaries that are issuing debt to
unaffiliated parties or that are relying to a significant
degree upon affiliated banks for funding.</b>  Significant is
defined as debt which exceeds the lesser of $10 million
or 5 percent of the bank holding company's consolidated
Tier 1 capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
<li><b>Those mortgage banking subsidiaries and other nonbank
subsidiaries involved in asset securitization, and all
nonbank subsidiaries that generate assets and sell them
to affiliated parties</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners involved in the on-site
review of these subsidiaries should consider the
appropriate examination guidelines for asset
securitization (e.g., set forth in SR 90-16, dated May
25, 1990, on asset securitization activities and in SR
91-2, dated January 31, 1991, on collateralized mortgage
obligations (CMOs) and real estate mortgage investment
conduits (REMICs)). <br>
<p>
<li><b>Consistent with existing examination guidelines, all
Section 20 subsidiaries should be subject to annual on-site review.</b>   SR 90-8, February 27, 1990, presented
extensive examination guidelines which have been
substantially updated and incorporated in the last two
revisions of the Bank Holding Company Supervision Manual. <br>
<p>
<li><b>All nonbank subsidiaries that provide derivative
instruments for sale or a service to unaffiliated
parties.</b> <br>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, for each credit-extending nonbank subsidiary
that meets the above on-site review criteria, examiners are to
review sufficient credit files through either judgmental or
attribute sampling to assess the adequacy and accuracy of internal
risk identification systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
<b>Off-site Review of Nonbank Activities</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserve Banks should review reports submitted to the
Federal Reserve to monitor the condition and performance of
significant nonbank subsidiaries between inspections.&nbsp;&nbsp;FR Y reports
on individual and combined nonbank subsidiaries should be used for
this purpose and, when available, financial statements on nonbank
activities that are included with the FR Y-6 annual reports of bank
holding companies should also be reviewed.<a href="#Footnote5" title="Footnote 5" name="Footref5"><SUP>5</SUP></a>  When warranted by a
deterioration in the condition and performance of nonbank
subsidiaries, the significance of the nonbank subsidiaries
(including those selected for on-site review as discussed above),
or other reasons, Reserve Banks should require bank holding
companies to submit additional information (e.g., balance sheets,
income statements, and schedules on nonperforming assets and off-balance sheet activities) obtained from a company's internal
systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, on an exception basis, Reserve Banks will
be expected to obtain information from a bank holding company's
internal systems on the off-balance sheet exposures of nonbank
subsidiaries and monitor the risks posed by these exposures when
considered significant.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Situations which the Reserve Bank identifies as
warranting material departure from these procedures should be
discussed with Board staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should you have any questions, please
contact either Howard Amer (ext. 2958), for multinational
organizations or Jack Jennings (ext. 3053), for regional and
community organizations.<br>

<a name="Footnote1">1.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The assessment of nonbank activities in large, complex organizations may be focused on an intermediate tier company with oversight responsibility for multiple nonbank subsidiaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref1">Return to text</a>
<P>
<a name="Footnote2">2.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The on-site review for these nonbank subsidiaries should be performed with the same frequency as required for a full scope inspection, but may be performed as a targeted review which is not concurrent with the full scope inspection.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref2">Return to text</a>
<P>
<a name="Footnote3">3.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Generally, examiners would not be required to conduct an on-site review of those nonbank subsidiaries that hold premises that are necessary for the operation of the banks or other affiliates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, these criteria are not intended to include nonbank subsidiaries that have been subject to recent on-site review by another federal or state banking agency in accordance with interagency agreements or Reserve Bank agreements with state banking supervisors (e.g., Interagency EDP Examination, Scheduling, and Distribution Policy).&nbsp;&nbsp;These criteria also should not limit Reserve Bank flexibility in coordinating supervisory efforts with functional regulators at the federal or state level.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref3">Return to text</a>
<P>
<a name="Footnote4">4.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For bank holding companies, &quot;total operating revenue&quot; is the sum of total interest income and total noninterest income (before extraordinary items).&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref4">Return to text</a>
<P>
<a name="Footnote5">5.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For example, combined financial statements of nonbank subsidiaries are submitted to the Board quarterly on form FR Y-11Q, and annually by type of nonbank subsidiary on form FR Y-11AS when the following criteria are met:<br><ul><li>The bank holding company has total consolidated assets of $1 billion or more; or</li><br><li>The bank holding company has total consolidated assets of $150 million or more but less than $1 billion and meets one or more of the following conditions:<br><ul><li>the assets of the bank holding company's nonbank subsidiaries make up 5 percent or more of the bank holding company's total consolidated assets;</li><br><li>the net income of the bank holding company's nonbank subsidiaries make up 5 percent or more of the bank holding company's total consolidated net income;</li><br><li>the bank holding company's investments in and/or loans and advances to nonbank subsidiaries exceed 5 percent of the bank holding company's total consolidated equity capital.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Annual reports of selected financial data for individual nonbank subsidiaries are also submitted to the Board on form FR Y-11I.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 20 subsidiaries submit quarterly financial statements to the Board on FR Y-20.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref5">Return to text</a>
