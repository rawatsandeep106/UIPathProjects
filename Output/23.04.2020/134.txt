            on Overdraft Protection Programs</div>
<!-- single space -->
<p>The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking 
  and credit union regulatory agencies have released 
  the attached guidance concerning a service offered 
  by some insured depository institutions that is commonly 
  referred to as &quot;bounced-check protection&quot; 
  or &quot;overdraft protection.&quot; This credit service 
  may be offered on both consumer and small business 
  transaction accounts in lieu of traditional ways of 
  covering overdrafts. The guidance is intended to assist 
  banking organizations with managing the risks presented 
  by overdraft protection programs.</p>
<p>The guidance is divided into five primary sections:</p>
<ol class="indent">
  <li>The evolution of banking organizations' practices 
    for paying overdrafts and common characteristics 
    of overdraft protection programs;</li>
  <li>concerns surrounding the marketing, disclosure, 
    and implementation of overdraft protection services;</li>
  <li>safety and soundness considerations including 
    the establishment of written policies and prudent 
    risk management practices to address the credit, 
    operational, and other risks associated with overdraft 
    protection programs and appropriate regulatory reporting 
    and risk-based capital treatment of overdraft exposures; 
  </li>
  <li>a discussion of the legal risks of overdraft protection 
    programs and the impact on these programs of other 
    laws, such as Federal Trade Commission Act/Advertising 
    Rules, Truth in Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity 
    Act, Truth in Savings Act, and Electronic Fund Transfer 
    Act; and </li>
  <li>best practices observed in the industry.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this guidance 
  to banking organizations supervised by the Federal 
  Reserve in their districts. If you have any questions 
  regarding this letter, please contact Suzanne&nbsp;Killian, 
  Assistant Director, Consumer Compliance Supervision, 
  Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, at (202)&nbsp;452-2090, 
  or William&nbsp;Tiernay, Supervisory Financial Analyst, 
  Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, at 
  (202)&nbsp;872-7579.</p>
