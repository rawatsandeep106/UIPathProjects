&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 10, 1995, the federal banking regulatory
agencies jointly issued a policy statement clarifying their
appraisal requirements for affordable housing loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of
this statement is attached.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As set forth in the statement, the agencies expect that
lenders will ensure that appraisals for affordable housing
projects consider and discuss the effect of certain types of
financial assistance (sometimes referred to as intangible items),
such as low-income tax credits, rent subsidies, and grants.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
statement also emphasizes that lenders should engage appraisers
who are competent to perform appraisals of affordable housing
projects, are knowledgeable about the various types of financial
assistance programs, and are able to appropriately identify and
consider the effect of such programs on the appraised value.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserve Banks should distribute this policy statement

<h4>Office of the Comptroller of the Currency<br>
Federal Reserve Board<br>
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation<br>
Office of Thrift Supervision<br>
<p>
<center>Interagency Statement on Appraisals<br>
for Affordable Housing Loans</center></h4>

<center>March 10, 1995</center>

<br>
<p>
<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>
This statement clarifies the position of the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve Board, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of Thrift Supervision
(collectively, the agencies) on the inclusion of various types of
financial assistance, sometimes referred to as intangible items,
in the determination of market value when a federally regulated
financial institution obtains an appraisal for an affordable
housing construction or permanent mortgage loan.<br>
<p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>
The agencies have long encouraged financial institutions to extend
prudent credit to promote community development.&nbsp;&nbsp;By taking the
initiative in community development, institutions may establish
new markets, reinforce their identity as community institutions,
and enhance their performance. <br>
<p>
An institution that extends credit for the development of an
affordable housing project should consider the financial
assistance that frequently accompanies these projects, such as
low-income housing tax credits (LIHTC), subsidies, and grants.
Such financial assistance creates an incentive for developers and
investors to undertake the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
The agencies understand that some institutions have received
appraisals where the appraiser has not appropriately considered
the various types of financial assistance that is provided to
affordable housing projects in the estimate of the project's
market value.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the benefits of such financial assistance is
not appropriately reflected in a project's appraisal, the
estimated cash flow of the project is negatively affected,
resulting in a lower market value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, a proposed
affordable housing loan may not have a loan-to-value ratio
sufficient to satisfy the standards of the agencies' real estate
lending guidelines or to receive favorable treatment under the
agencies' risk-based capital rules.
<p>
<h4>Statement</h4>
<p>
When a regulated financial institution obtains an appraisal for an
affordable housing project, the appraisal should contain a market
value estimate that reflects the real estate collateral and
typical interests in the real estate on a cash or cash equivalent
basis.<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></a>  The agencies' appraisal regulations permit the appraiser
to include in the market value estimate any significant financial
assistance that would survive sale or foreclosure, such as the
value of LIHTC, subsidies, and grants. <br>
<p>
An institution should ensure that an appraiser engaged to appraise
an affordable housing project is competent to perform such an
appraisal; is knowledgeable about the various types of financial
assistance and programs that are associated with an affordable
housing project; and identifies and considers the effect on value
of any significant amount of the financial assistance.
Consequently, the appraisal should contain a discussion of the
value of the financial assistance that would survive sale or
foreclosure and how it effects the market value estimate of the
project.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, while certain types of financial assistance
such as tenant-based rent subsidies do not necessarily transfer to
new ownership upon sale or foreclosure, the lender should ensure
that the appraiser appropriately considers the effect of these
items in the cash flow analysis, when applicable.<br>
