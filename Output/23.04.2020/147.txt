<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Interagency Guidance on Concentrations 
   in Commercial Real Estate</div>
<p>On December 6, 2006, the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking regulatory 
   agencies issued interagency guidance on <i>Concentrations in Commercial Real 
   Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices</i>.<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp; 
   Attachment&nbsp;1 provides the <i>Federal Register</i> notice of the guidance.<a href="#Footnote2" name="Footref2" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;
   Attachment&nbsp;2 provides the interagency guidance. The guidance is applicable 
   to state member banks and broadly applicable to bank holding companies and 
   their non-bank subsidiaries. </p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Background</div>
<p>Over the past several years, the agencies have observed that commercial real 
   estate lending&nbsp;(CRE) concentrations have been rising at many institutions, 
   especially small-to-medium-sized institutions. While most institutions' underwriting 
   practices are sound, the agencies have observed that some institutions' risk 
   management practices and capital levels have not evolved with the level and 
   nature of their CRE concentrations. Therefore, the agencies issued the guidance 
   to remind institutions that strong risk management practices and appropriate 
   levels of capital are important elements of a sound CRE lending program, especially 
   when an institution has a CRE concentration or a CRE lending strategy leading 
   to a concentration.</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Purpose</div>
<p>The guidance provides a principle-based discussion of supervisory expectations 
   for sound risk management practices and evaluation of capital adequacy. As 
   such, the guidance is not intended to be implemented through a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; 
   supervisory approach. Rather, examiners are expected to exercise judgment 
   when evaluating the appropriateness of an institution's risk management practices 
   and capital levels relative to the size and complexity of its CRE portfolio 
   and level and nature of CRE concentration risk.</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Scope</div>
<p>The guidance applies to concentrations in CRE loans sensitive to the cyclicality 
   of CRE markets. For purposes of this guidance, CRE loans include loans where 
   repayment is dependent on the rental income or the sale or refinancing of 
   the real estate held as collateral. The guidance does not apply to loans where 
   real estate is taken as a secondary source of repayment or through an abundance 
   of caution.</p>
<p>The guidance notes that risk characteristics vary among CRE loans secured 
   by different property types. A manageable level of CRE concentration risk 
   will vary depending on the portfolio risk characteristics, the quality of 
   risk management processes, and the level of capital. Therefore, the guidance 
   does not establish a CRE concentration limit that applies to all institutions. 
   Rather, the guidance encourages institutions to perform ongoing risk assessments 
   to identify and monitor CRE concentrations. These risk assessments will be 
   an important consideration in an examiner's review of an institution's CRE 
   lending activity and concentration risk. </p>
<p>The guidance provides numerical indicators as supervisory screening criteria 
   to identify institutions that may have CRE concentrations that warrant greater 
   supervisory scrutiny. The screening criteria should serve as a starting point 
   for a dialogue between the supervisory staff and an institution's management 
   about the level and nature of the institution's CRE concentration risk.</p>
<p>The supervisory screening criteria are not intended to be viewed as a &quot;safe 
   harbor&quot; if other risk indicators are present. For example, institutions 
   experiencing recent, significant growth in CRE lending may receive closer 
   supervisory review than other institutions regardless of their level of CRE 
   concentration. Similarly, institutions with CRE levels below the screening 
   criteria but with high risk profiles may also be subject to closer supervisory 
   review.</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Implementation</div>
<p>The guidance is effective as of December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2006, the date of issuance 
   in the <i>Federal&nbsp;Register</i>. However, institutions needing to improve 
   their risk management processes may be granted some flexibility on the timeframe 
   for complying with the guidance. This timeframe should be commensurate with 
   the level and nature of CRE concentration risk, the quality of the institution's 
   existing risk management practices, and its levels of capital. To ensure consistent 
   and appropriate application of this guidance, the Federal&nbsp;Reserve is 
   developing training materials for examiners addressing the guidance. These 
   training materials will include FAQs and updates to examination manuals and 
   training course materials. <br>
   <br>
   Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this SR&nbsp;letter to state member 
   banks and bank holding companies in their districts, as well as to their supervisory 
   and examination staff and the state banking departments in their districts.
