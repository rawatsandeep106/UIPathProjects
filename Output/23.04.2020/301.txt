&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On March 30, 1993, the Federal Reserve Board, the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision
issued a policy statement on the documentation of loans to small-and medium-sized businesses and farms.&nbsp;&nbsp;That policy is intended
to eliminate unnecessary documentation on small and medium-sized
business and farm loans for institutions that are highly-rated
and that are well or adequately capitalized.&nbsp;&nbsp; These institutions
will be allowed to identify, within certain limits, an &quot;exempt
portion&quot; of their small and medium-sized business and farm loan
portfolios that will be evaluated solely on performance and will
be exempt from examiner criticism of documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Interagency Joint Release and Policy Statement provide details of
this program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of those documents are attached.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this supplementary issuance is to
clarify the applicability of the March 30, 1993, interagency
policy statement to the lending activities of U.S. branches and
agencies of foreign banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, although most U.S.
branches and agencies of foreign banks do not pursue lending to
these customers, those that do lend to small and medium-sized
businesses and farms will be permitted to do so under the same
general guidelines detailed in the policy statement for domestic
U.S. financial institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such lending, when undertaken,
should conform to clearly defined policies from the branch or
agency's head office which approve this activity and delineate
its scope.&nbsp;&nbsp;The size and scope of such lending should reflect
appropriate consideration of the expertise of the foreign bank
and its U.S. offices in lending to small and medium-sized
businesses and farms in the United States.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of differences between the structure and
operations of domestic financial institutions and those of U.S.
branches and agencies of foreign banks, the following
supplementary considerations to the general interagency policy
are appropriate:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>a branch or agency of a foreign bank is eligible for
participation in the program if:<br>
<p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>the branch or agency was assigned a composite AIM
rating of 1 or 2 at its most recent examination; and, <br>
<p>
<li>the branch or agency, any other U.S. office of the
parent foreign bank, and/or the parent foreign bank itself is 				  					not subject to any supervisory enforcement action with any federal or
state bank regulatory authority; <br>
<p>
</ul>

<li>with the exception of insured branches, as detailed below,
the limitations in the March 30,1993, policy statement that
are based on an institution's total capital will be based on
the consolidated total capital of the parent foreign bank; <br>
<p>
<li>for insured branches, the above limits must be based on the
excess of eligible assets over liabilities (12 CFR Ch. III,
346.20(a)) maintained at the individual branch.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<p>
<li>for each foreign bank, the limitations established in the
March 30, 1993, policy statement will apply to the aggregate
of the loans granted pursuant to this policy by all U.S.
branches and agencies of that bank; <br>
<p>
<li>small and medium-sized businesses and farm loans eligible
for inclusion in the program will be limited to those
extended to U.S.-resident borrowers. <br>
</ul>
<p>
All other requirements and limitations of the interagency policy
statement will be applicable to the small and medium-sized
business and farm lending of U.S. branches and agencies of
foreign banks.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with supervisory practice, these guidelines
do not supersede any documentation requirements mandated by the
licensing authority of the branch or agency.<br>
