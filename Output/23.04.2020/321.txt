<font SIZE=3><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, examiners' access to automated databases that include
supervisory data on state member banks (SMBs) and bank holding companies (BHCs) has
been significantly enhanced.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the increased availability of copiers, fax
machines, and personal computers has made it possible for SMBs and BHCs to more easily
transfer data to Reserve Banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the volume of information on SMBs and BHCs
available to examiners in Reserve Bank offices has been greatly augmented and many
examination and inspection activities that have traditionally been conducted in the field can
now be completed in Reserve Bank offices.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various advantages to be gained in completing these activities in
Reserve Bank offices.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, examiners' ability to access automation resources,
reference materials, and senior staff is much better in the office than on-site.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition,
in completing more activities off-site, Reserve Banks can reduce the burdens of on-site
evaluations on SMBs and BHCs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, greater reliance on off-site work can allow
Reserve Banks to reduce travel-related expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the use of these approaches can
significantly reduce the burden on examiners of spending time away from home.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the above, Reserve Banks are asked to adopt the following
recommendations to increase the portion of examinations and inspections conducted in
Reserve Bank offices.&nbsp;&nbsp;These recommendations were developed by a Task Force of the
Supervision Efficiency Enhancement Project.<br>
<p>
<b>Conducting Examination and Inspection Activities in Reserve Bank Offices</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should conduct in Reserve Bank offices all examination and
inspection activities that can be efficiently and effectively completed off-site.&nbsp;&nbsp;Activities
that may be completed off-site include planning the examination or inspection, reviewing
historical information, completing preliminary financial analyses, and preparing certain
report pages using data maintained at Reserve Bank offices.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When using this approach, SMBs and BHCs should be contacted by letter
and asked to forward to Reserve Bank offices financial and other information to be used in
the off-site portion of the examination or inspection.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most information that has
traditionally been requested in first day letters and made available to examiners at the start
of an examination or inspection, with the exception of documents such as minute books or
bulky printouts that would be inappropriate or impractical to have sent, should be
requested.&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is anticipated that this approach will be preferred to approaches that
require a longer on-site examiner presence, SMBs and BHCs are not required to be
examined and inspected under this approach and should be given the option to be
examined or inspected using traditional on-site approaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the burdens imposed by
having SMBs and BHCs prepare and mail materials to Reserve Bank offices, Reserve Banks
should also offer to pay the shipping costs and give adequate lead time in requesting
materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cases of certain shell BHCs, Reserve Banks are authorized to complete
all inspection activities off-site on an every-other-inspection basis<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted above,
however, these BHCs should be given the option to be inspected using the traditional on-site approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;During a three year pilot testing period, non-complex shell bank holding
companies (NCSBHCs)<a href="#Footnote2" title="Footnote 2" name="Footref2"><SUP>2</SUP></a> with less than $500 million in assets that on their last inspection
were rated BOPEC 3 or better may be inspected off-site, subject to the following
restrictions:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>If information becomes available to the Reserve Bank in the period between
inspections suggesting that the condition of an organization is deteriorating
significantly, an on-site inspection should be scheduled or commenced immediately
if warranted. <br>
<p>
<li>Deteriorating 3-rated BHCs are excluded from the pilot program and must be
inspected on-site.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<p>
<li>When a BHC's lead bank subsidiary is a SMB, the inspection of the BHC should be
carried out in the field concurrently with the examination of its lead bank. <br>
<p>
<li>NCSBHCs in the same Metropolitan Statistical Area as the Reserve Bank or its bank
supervision staff should be inspected on-site unless there is good reason to do
otherwise. <br>
<p>
<li>Newly-formed NCSBHCs or those that have recently undergone a change in control
should be inspected on-site. <br>
<p>
<li>In cases where a BHC is unable to forward the information necessary to conduct an
off-site inspection, or where the company is assigned a BOPEC rating of 4 or 5 or is
determined to be a deteriorating 3-rated organization as a result of an off-site
inspection, an on-site inspection should be scheduled or commenced immediately if
warranted. <br>
<p>
<li>Information requested from the NCSBHC should include all information typically
requested in a first day letter, as well as copies from the company's general and
subsidiary ledgers that document all significant accounting entries made since the
last on-site inspection; copies of cancelled checks written since the last on-site
inspection; copies of the BHC's notes payable and receivable; copies of all
agreements between the BHC and its bank subsidiaries; and any other information
considered to be necessary to complete an off-site inspection of the institution. <br>
<p>
<li>Findings regarding the BHC's condition and compliance with laws and regulations
should be conveyed to management by telephone or, if the situation requires, at
company or Reserve Bank offices.&nbsp;&nbsp;The examiner-in-charge should then complete an
inspection report for transmission to the company. <br>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attachments 1 and 2 include procedures that can be used in implementing
off-site approaches to the examination of SMBs and the inspection of BHCs, respectively.
Attachment 3 includes procedures for implementing the pilot program authorizing off-site
inspections for certain shell BHCs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
<b>Increasing Use of Automation</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure that maximum benefit is achieved from automation
resources, Reserve Banks should review their use of automation in conducting examination
and inspection activities and make increased use of automation to the extent deemed to be
cost effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;At a minimum, those Reserve Banks that have not developed systems
capable of downloading financial data from Federal Reserve databases into automated
report forms should adopt such a system.&nbsp;&nbsp;In meeting this recommendation, Reserve Banks
that have already adopted such systems should be consulted in order to avoid repeating
costly development processes.<br>
<p>
<b>Using Specialized Support Staff</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparing for an examination or inspection involves intensive data collection
and data entry.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the professional examiner staff is currently performing these functions,
efficiencies can be gained by reassigning these tasks to support staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserve Banks,
therefore, should consider initiating the use of such support staffs when efficiencies can be
obtained.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have any questions regarding the recommendations detailed above,
please contact Kevin Bertsch at (202/452-5265).<br>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attachment describes general procedures that can be followed in
increasing the portion of examinations conducted in Reserve Bank offices, lists examination
activities that can be completed in the office and those that should be conducted on-site,
and includes a sample first day letter information request form that can be used in
complying with this SR letter.<br>
<p>
<b>General Procedures</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When institutions are examined using this approach, first day letters are sent
requesting that an array of documents be duplicated and forwarded to the Reserve Bank
office for use during a preliminary phase of the examination.&nbsp;&nbsp;This array includes almost all
of the documents that have traditionally been compiled and held for examiners in the field.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once requested information has been received at the Reserve Bank, staff
designated to perform the examination begins its analysis of the bank using both
information submitted by the institution and that already available in the Reserve Bank's
office.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of this analysis, as much data as possible is entered into the
examination report form and certain report pages are partially or fully completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Work to
be carried out in the field is also fully planned.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, field work begins and activities
which can only be done effectively on-site are carried out at the subject institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The examination procedures described above should be tailored to the overall
supervisory strategy for an institution, not applied mechanically.&nbsp;&nbsp;The total resources
devoted to a particular institution, as well as the allocation of field versus office time,
should be based on a thorough understanding of the risk profile of the institution.
Examiners should use prior examinations, in-house financial analyses, and other sources of
information to determine actual and potential areas of weakness.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent
weaknesses or unfavorable trends are detected in any of the CAMEL components, more
field time should be devoted to these areas.<br>
<p>
<b>Activities that can be completed in Reserve Bank offices</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserve Banks are encouraged to conduct the following portions of
commercial bank examinations in the office:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Determination of the scope of the examination, including the  cut-off for credit
review;  <br>
<p>
<li>Review of historical financial and supervisory data, leading to preparation of draft
financial analyses (e.g. earnings, capital, liquidity); <br>
<p>
<li>Review of a bank's internal reports; <br>
<p>
<li>Review of a bank's written policies and procedures to produce a preliminary
evaluation of management and internal controls; and <br>
<p>
<li>Completion of financial schedules and certain other pages. <br>
</ul>
<p>
With regard to credit review, typically the largest part of a bank examination, preliminary
office work could include:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Review of loan policies; <br>
<p>
<li>Review of performance report ratio data and management reports; <br>
<p>
<li>Preliminary review of the loan loss reserve methodology; <br>
<p>
<li>Risk assessment to determine the areas to be emphasized in the on-site review; <br>
<p>
<li>Determination of the percentage of loans to be reviewed, and selection and
assignment of individual credits;  <br>
<p>
<li>Grouping of loans to related obligors; and <br>
<p>
<li>Preparation of loan line sheets. <br>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Activities that should be conducted on-site</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recommended that the following examination activities continue to be
performed in the field:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Review of credit and investment files for quality, documentation, and compliance
with bank policy and laws and regulations; <br>
<p>
<li>In-depth discussions with management; <br>
<p>
<li>Verification of selected financial information; <br>
<p>
<li>Observation of bank operations and internal controls; <br>
<p>
<li>Collection of follow-up documentation to complete the financial analysis; <br>
<p>
<li>Review of documents such as minute books and bulky printouts that would be
inappropriate or impractical to have sent to the office; and <br>
<p>
<li>Exit meetings with management. <br>
</ul>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attachment lists inspection activities that can be completed in the office and those
that should be conducted on-site and includes a sample first day letter information request form that can
be used in complying with this SR letter.<br>
<p>
<b>Activities that can be completed in the office</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For bank holding company inspections, Reserve Banks are encouraged to adopt the same
approach as that described in attachment 1 for bank examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, work performed in the
office in preparation for a bank holding company inspection should include:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Determination of the scope of inspection; <br>
<p>
<li>Completion of financial schedules and certain other pages; and <br>
<p>
<li>Review of historical financial and supervisory data leading to preparation of draft financial
analyses (e.g. parent, subsidiary bank(s), consolidated entity). <br>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, if centralized management functions (e.g. investments, asset/liability
management, internal audit, or loan review) are performed by the bank holding company, a preliminary
understanding of these functions can be obtained in the office by reviewing policies, reports, and other
relevant materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if the bank holding company has nonbank subsidiaries, the preliminary risk
assessment mandated by SR 93-19 can be performed in the office, based on information submitted by
the institution.<br>
<p>
<b>Activities that should be conducted on-site<br></b>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recommended that the following inspection activities continue to be performed in the
field:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Review of credit and investment files at holding company and nonbank subsidiaries for quality,
documentation, and compliance with policy and laws and regulations; <br>
<p>
<li>In-depth discussions with management; <br>
<p>
<li>Verification of selected financial information; <br>
<p>
<li>Review of selected tax workpapers, including the review of intercompany tax allocations; <br>
<p>
<li>Observation of operations and internal controls; <br>
<p>
<li>Collection of follow-up documentation to complete the financial analysis; <br>
<p>
<li>Review of documents such as minute books for the holding company and nonbank subsidiaries
and bulky printouts that would be inappropriate or impractical to have sent to the office; and <br>
<p>
<li>Exit meetings with management. <br>
</ul>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attachment describes general procedures that can be followed in implementing the
pilot program for off-site inspections of certain non-complex shell bank holding companies (NCSBHCS).
In addition, the attachment includes sample documents that can be used in implementing the program,
including examples of correspondence with eligible bank holding companies and a sample first day letter
information request form.<br>
<p>
<b>General Procedures</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In implementing the pilot program, Reserve Banks should conform to the following
procedures:  <br>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Senior management of bank holding companies should be notified prior to or early in the calendar
year if their company qualifies for a full off-site inspection.  They should also be informed that
they may opt out of the off-site process and that, even if they choose to participate, the Reserve
Bank may conduct the inspection on-site if conditions change or if it turns out that at some point
during the year examiners will be traveling to the company's vicinity to carry out other activities. <br>
<p>
<li>When the Reserve Bank is ready to conduct the off-site inspection, the holding company should
be contacted by telephone, as well as by letter.  An information request form should be attached
to the letter. <br>
<p>
<li>After assigned examiner(s) have reviewed information forwarded by the company, additional
information may be requested by telephone or other means if deemed necessary.  Once all
necessary information has been received, the designated examiner(s) should commence the off-site inspection.  <br>
<p>
<li>Findings of the inspection should be conveyed to company management by telephone or, if the
situation requires, at company or Reserve Bank offices. <br>
<p>
<li>The examiner-in-charge should then complete an inspection report for transmission to the
company. <br>
