<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   On November&nbsp;26,&nbsp;2001, significant revisions to 
   Regulation&nbsp;K came into effect that generally streamline 
   applications requirements and, in certain instances, reduce filing 
   requirements.&nbsp; The primary revision that affects the 
   applications function is the adoption of new 12-day and 30-day 
   prior notice procedures with respect to foreign activities by 
   U.S.&nbsp;banking organizations.&nbsp; Prior to the revisions, 
   these types of proposals were generally processed using a 45-day 
   prior notice or 60-day specific consent procedure.&nbsp;</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The purpose of this letter is to provide a general description of 
   the procedural changes contained in the revised 
   Regulation&nbsp;K.&nbsp; In addition, this letter establishes 
   procedures for processing the new 12-day and 30-day prior 
   notifications and revises existing processing procedures to be 
   more consistent with procedures for other types of applications, 
   including those filed under Regulation&nbsp;Y.<a 
   href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Attachment&nbsp;A 
   contains revised processing guidelines for prior notifications 
   and applications filed under Regulation&nbsp;K.&nbsp; The new 
   processing guidelines allow requests for additional information 
   to be made on an as-needed basis and do not establish a rigid 
   timeline for these requests.&nbsp; However, Reserve Bank staff 
   should be aware of the new shortened time periods and the need 
   to request information in a timely fashion in order to meet the 
   new deadlines.&nbsp; The guidelines suggest that, in 30-day 
   cases, additional information should be requested within 
   8&nbsp;business days and that, in 12-day cases, additional 
   information should be requested within 5&nbsp;business 
   days.&nbsp; In the case of 12-day prior notices, Reserve Bank 
   staff is requested to fax a copy of the notice and control 
   sheet to the Clearing Unit upon receipt in order to ensure 
   timely processing.&nbsp; The shortened time periods, combined 
   with potential mail delays, significantly increase the need for 
   Reserve Bank staff to promptly forward copies of filings to the 
   Clearing Unit.&nbsp;</p> 

<p><b>Summary of Changes to Subpart A of Regulation K</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <i>Establishment of foreign branches</i>.&nbsp; The processing 
   procedure for a member bank to establish a branch in the first 
   and second foreign country has been changed from specific 
   consent (60-day processing track) to 30-day prior notice.&nbsp; 
   Further, member banks that operate branches in two or more 
   foreign countries may now establish an additional foreign branch 
   after providing 12&nbsp;business days prior notice to the 
   Board.&nbsp; Prior to the revisions, proposals to establish 
   additional foreign branches were processed on a 45-day prior 
   notice track.&nbsp; Proposals to establish a subsidiary of a 
   foreign branch, or to engage in activities in a foreign branch 
   that are not listed in section&nbsp;211.4 of Regulation&nbsp;K, 
   continue to require the specific consent of the Board (60-day 
   processing track).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <i>Investments in Foreign Organizations</i>.&nbsp; The revisions 
   to Regulation&nbsp;K significantly expand the general consent 
   authority for well-capitalized and well-managed investors.&nbsp; 
   The new general consent limits are summarized in Attachment&nbsp;B.&nbsp; 
   The new limits are tied to the capital of the investor and vary 
   depending on whether the investment is to be made in a subsidiary 
   or a joint venture, or is a portfolio investment, and whether 
   the investment is being made by a bank holding company, 
   member bank, or Edge or agreement corporation.<a href="#Footnote2" 
   name="Footref2"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp; For investors that do not 
   meet the well-capitalized and well-managed criteria, the general 
   consent limit in most instances is $25&nbsp;million.&nbsp; There 
   are also aggregate limits on the amount of investments that may 
   be made using the general consent procedures over a 12-month 
   period.<a href="#Footnote3" name="Footref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   For proposals to make foreign investments that exceed the general 
   consent limits, the prior notification period has been shortened 
   from 45&nbsp;days to 30&nbsp;days.&nbsp; Investments that do not 
   qualify for the general consent or prior notice procedures 
   continue to require the specific consent of the Board (60-day 
   processing track).&nbsp;</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   An organization's first foreign investment under 
   Regulation&nbsp;K continues to require the specific consent of 
   the Board.&nbsp; If the first foreign investment would otherwise 
   qualify under general consent procedures, approval is delegable 
   to the responsible Reserve Bank.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   For investments that exceed the general consent limits and are 
   intended to be made over a period exceeding 12&nbsp;months, the 
   revised Regulation&nbsp;K provides for a preclearance process for 
   a long-range investment plan.&nbsp; Approval of preclearance 
   requests is delegated to the Director of the Division of Banking 
   Supervision and Regulation.&nbsp; Such requests would generally 
   be acted on within 60&nbsp;days of receipt.&nbsp;</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <i>Edge and Agreement Corporations</i>.&nbsp; Proposals to 
   establish an Edge or agreement corporation continue to be subject 
   to the specific consent procedures (60-day processing 
   track).&nbsp; Additionally, the revised Regulation&nbsp;K 
   implements a statutory provision that allows member banks to 
   invest more than 10&nbsp;percent and up to 20&nbsp;percent of 
   capital and surplus in the stock of Edge and agreement 
   corporations.&nbsp; Such proposals are delegable to the 
   responsible Reserve Bank if no issues are raised and provided 
   that the member bank's total investment, including the retained 
   earnings of the Edge and agreement corporation subsidiaries, 
   does not exceed 20&nbsp;percent of the bank's capital and surplus 
   or would not exceed that level as a result of the proposal.&nbsp; 
   It is expected that such proposals would continue to be accepted 
   for Board action in order to ensure consistent treatment and 
   review, as well as to ensure that the proposals do not raise 
   issues that should be presented to the Board.&nbsp; Applications 
   that are determined to have no issues would be delegated back to 
   the responsible Reserve Bank for approval action.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <i>Securities Activities</i>.&nbsp; The revisions to 
   Regulation&nbsp;K substantially liberalized equity underwriting 
   authority.&nbsp; For well-capitalized and well-managed investors, 
   the equity underwriting limit has been increased from an effective 
   $60&nbsp;million limit on uncovered exposures to a limit tied 
   solely to a percentage of the investor's tier&nbsp;1 capital 
   (15&nbsp;percent of the tier&nbsp;1 capital of the bank holding 
   company for underwriting through holding company subsidiaries 
   or, for subsidiaries of Edge corporations, the lesser of three 
   percent of the tier&nbsp;1 capital of the bank or 15&nbsp;percent 
   of the tier&nbsp;1 capital of the Edge).&nbsp; For investors that 
   do&nbsp;not meet the well-capitalized and well-managed standard, 
   existing dollar limits are retained.&nbsp; Processing procedures 
   for proposals to engage in equity underwriting were changed from 
   specific consent (60-day processing track) to 30-day prior 
   notice.&nbsp; The bulk of the review for these types of proposals 
   would generally be performed by supervisory staff responsible for 
   the applicant organization as part of the overall appraisal of 
   the applicant's policies, procedures, and controls.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Equity dealing authority is also liberalized.&nbsp; Equity 
   dealing activities are now subject to a limit of $40&nbsp;million 
   (an increase from $30&nbsp;million) on net long positions in a 
   single issuer.<a href="#Footnote4" 
   name="Footref4"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp; No distinction in limits 
   is made between well-capitalized and well-managed investors and 
   investors that do not meet the well-capitalized and well-managed 
   criteria.&nbsp; In order to take advantage of the higher limit, 
   an investor must provide 30-day prior notice.&nbsp; The revised 
   Regulation&nbsp;K also contains a provision for allowing 
   organizations to use internal hedging models to net and offset 
   positions in a security in calculating compliance with the single 
   issuer dealing limit.&nbsp; Proposals to use the netting 
   authority under Regulation&nbsp;K also require 30-day prior 
   notice.&nbsp; As with equity underwriting, the bulk of the review 
   for these types of proposals would generally be performed by 
   supervisory staff responsible for the applicant organization as 
   part of the overall appraisal of the applicant's policies, 
   procedures, and controls.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <i>Advisory Opinions</i>.&nbsp; New section&nbsp;211.11 of 
   Regulation&nbsp;K provides a procedure for requesting an advisory 
   opinion regarding the scope of activities permissible under the 
   regulation.&nbsp; The request for an advisory opinion should be 
   submitted in writing.&nbsp; A response to the request will usually 
   be provided within 45&nbsp;days after the record on the request 
   has been determined to be complete.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Summary of Changes to Subpart B of Regulation K</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The revised Regulation&nbsp;K provides for expanded use of the 
   45-day prior notice procedure for foreign banks to establish 
   additional offices in the United States.&nbsp; Any foreign bank 
   that has been determined to be subject to comprehensive 
   consolidated supervision may establish additional branches, 
   agencies, commercial lending company subsidiaries, and 
   representative offices pursuant to the 45-day prior notice 
   procedure.&nbsp; Additionally, a foreign bank that is subject to 
   the provisions of the Bank Holding Company&nbsp;Act, but 
   has&nbsp;not received a comprehensive consolidated supervision 
   determination, is permitted to use the 45-day notice procedure to 
   establish a representative office.<a href="#Footnote5" 
   name="Footref5"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp; Finally, any foreign bank 
   that has received approval to establish a representative office 
   may establish additional representative offices using the 
   45-day prior notice procedure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   General consent procedures can now be used by banking 
   organizations that are subject to the Bank Holding 
   Company&nbsp;Act and that have received a comprehensive 
   consolidated supervision determination in connection with the 
   establishment of a representative office.</p>

<p><b>Anti-Money Laundering Compliance</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The Federal Reserve has a longstanding practice of considering an 
   applicant's compliance with applicable anti-money laundering laws 
   and regulations, including pertinent examination findings by 
   other regulators where the application involves, for example, a 
   national or state nonmember bank or a foreign banking 
   organization.&nbsp; The importance of efforts to combat money 
   laundering were recently underscored by enactment of the 
   USA&nbsp;Patriot&nbsp;Act that, among other matters, requires 
   consideration of anti-money laundering compliance in connection 
   with certain applications filed under the Bank Merger&nbsp;Act or 
   section&nbsp;3 of the Bank Holding Company&nbsp;Act.&nbsp; 
   Although these provisions do not apply to applications filed under 
   subparts&nbsp;A and&nbsp;B of Regulation&nbsp;K, the Board 
   nonetheless will continue its practice of taking into account the 
   applicant's anti-money laundering compliance record in acting on 
   Regulation&nbsp;K proposals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   This letter and its attachments are to be distributed to Reserve 
   Bank staff responsible for processing applications under 
   Regulation&nbsp;K and such staff are advised to become familiar 
   with the revised regulation.&nbsp; If there are any questions,

<p><b>Note:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p><a name="Footnote1"></a>
    In June&nbsp;2001, the Board approved broad delegation of 
    authority to the Director of the Division of Banking Supervision 
    and Regulation and the General Counsel to act on proposals under 
    Regulation&nbsp;K that do&nbsp;not raise significant issues or 
    otherwise require consideration by the Board.&nbsp; It is 
    anticipated that most proposals under Regulation&nbsp;K that 
    formerly were processed for Board action will be processed as 
    Division Director delegated matters.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a 
    href="#Footref1">Return&nbsp;to&nbsp;text</a></p></li>

<li><p><a name="Footnote2"></a>
    An investment in a foreign bank is ineligible for the general 
    consent procedures if after the investment the foreign bank would 
    be an affiliate of a member bank and the foreign bank is 
    located in a country in which the member bank and its affiliates 
    have no banking presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a 
    href="#Footref2">Return&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;text</a></p></li>

<li><p><a name="Footnote3"></a>
    Only investments made subsequent to November&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2001, 
    will be considered in determining compliance with the rolling 
    12-month aggregate general consent limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a 
    href="#Footref3">Return&nbsp;to&nbsp;text</a></p></li>

<li><p><a name="Footnote4"></a>
    For purposes of determining compliance with the single issuer 
    limits, the revised Regulation&nbsp;K distinguishes between 
    customer-driven equity derivatives activities and other 
    equity dealing activities such as market making and proprietary 
    equities activities.&nbsp; Customer-driven equity derivatives 
    activities are allowable under the "commercial banking" 
    activity of section&nbsp;211.10(a)(1) of Regulation&nbsp;K and 
    are&nbsp;not included in calculating compliance with the single 
    issuer equity dealing limit except that any residual (unhedged) 
    position must be carried over and included in the 
    limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a 
    href="#Footref4">Return&nbsp;to&nbsp;text</a></p></li>

<li><p><a name="Footnote5"></a>
    In such cases, it is possible that the foreign bank has not yet 
    been subject to the namecheck process.  It is anticipated that 
    name checks would be initiated in the context of the 45-day 
    prior notice, but completion of the name check process 
    would&nbsp;not always be necessary to complete processing of 
    the notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
