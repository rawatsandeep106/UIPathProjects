supervisory policy concerning the sale of certain uninsured debt

the Federal Reserve's longstanding posture regarding this
practice.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserve Bank supervisory and examination personnel are
asked to ensure that bank holding companies and state member banks

necessary steps to achieve full compliance with the policy.
Reserve Banks should provide copies of the attached statement to
any banking organizations engaged in the sale of holding company
obligations on the premises of their affiliated banks, or to any
other organization if necessary to facilitate compliance.

<center>Sale of Uninsured Debt Obligations and Securities<br>
Issued by Bank Holding Companies, Nonbank Affiliates,<br>
or State Member Banks on Retail Banking Premises</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a longstanding policy of the Federal Reserve that
debt obligations of a bank holding company or a nonbank affiliate
should not be issued, marketed or sold in a way that conveys the
misimpression or misunderstanding that such instruments are
either: 1) federally-insured deposits, or 2) obligations of, or
guaranteed by, an insured depository institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchase of
such holding company obligations by retail depositors of an
affiliated depository institution can, in the event of default,
result in losses to individuals who believed that they had
acquired federally-insured or guaranteed instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition
to the problems created for these individuals, such a situation
could impair public confidence in the affiliated depository
institution and lead to unexpected withdrawals or liquidity
pressures.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Recent events surrounding the sale of uninsured debt
obligations of holding companies to retail customers of
affiliated depository institutions have focused renewed attention
on the potential for problems in this area.&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these
concerns, this letter is intended to reiterate the Federal
Reserve's supervisory policy regarding these activities and to
emphasize that it applies to the sale of both long- and short-term
debt obligations of a bank holding company and any nonbank
affiliate, as well as to the sale of uninsured debt securities
issued by a state member bank or its subsidiaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Debt
obligations covered by this supervisory policy include commercial
paper and all other short-term and long-term debt securities, such
as thrift notes and subordinated debentures.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank holding companies and nondepository affiliates that
have issued or plan to issue uninsured obligations or debt
securities should not market or sell these instruments in any
public area of an insured depository institution where retail
deposits are accepted, including any lobby area of the depository
institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank holding companies and any affiliates that are
engaged in issuing debt obligations should establish appropriate
policies and controls over the marketing and sale of the
instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, internal controls should be
established to ensure that the promotion, sale, and subsequent
customer relationship resulting from the sale of uninsured debt
obligations is separated from the retail deposit-taking functions
of affiliated depository institutions.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State member banks, including their subsidiaries, may
also be engaged in issuing nondeposit debt securities (such as
subordinated debt), and it is equally important to ensure that
such securities are not marketed or sold in a manner that could
give the purchaser the impression that the obligations are
federally-insured deposits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, state member banks and
their subsidiaries that have issued or plan to issue nondeposit
debt securities should not market or sell these instruments in any
public area of the bank where retail deposits are accepted,
including any lobby area of the bank.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with longstanding Federal Reserve policy,
debt obligations of bank holding companies or their nonbank
affiliates, including commercial paper and other short- or long-
term debt securities, should prominently indicate that: 1) they
are not obligations of an insured depository institution and 2)
they are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
In cases where purchasers do not take physical possession of the
obligation, the purchasers should be provided with a printed
advice that conveys this information.&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees engaged in the
sale of bank holding company debt obligations should be instructed
to relate this information verbally to potential purchasers.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, with respect to the sale of holding company debt
obligations, the instruments or related documentation should not
display the name of the affiliated bank in such a way that could
create confusion among potential purchasers about the identity of
the obligor.&nbsp;&nbsp;State member banks involved in the sale of uninsured
nondeposit debt securities of the bank should establish procedures
to ensure that potential purchasers understand that the debt
security is not federally-insured or guaranteed.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal Reserve examiners are responsible for monitoring
compliance with this supervisory policy; and, as part of the
examination of state member banks and bank holding companies, are
expected to continue to review the polices and internal controls
relating to the marketing and sale of debt obligations and
securities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should determine whether the marketing and
sale of uninsured nondeposit debt obligations are sufficiently
separated and distinguished from retail banking operations,
particularly the deposit-taking function of the insured depository
affiliate.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether the activities are sufficiently
separated, examiners should take into account: 1) whether the sale
of uninsured debt obligations of a holding company affiliate or
uninsured nondeposit debt securities of a state member bank is
physically separated from the bank's retail-deposit taking
function, including the general lobby area<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></a>;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) whether
advertisements that promote uninsured debt obligations of the
holding company also promote insured deposits of the affiliated
depository institution in a way that could lead to confusion; 3)
whether similar names or logos between the insured depository
institution and the issuing nonbank affiliate are used in a
misleading way to promote securities of a nonbank affiliate
without clearly identifying the obligor; 4) whether retail
deposit-taking employees of the insured depository institution are
engaged in the promotion or sale of uninsured debt securities of a
nonbank affiliate; 5) whether information on the sale of uninsured
debt obligations of a nonbank holding company affiliate is
available in the retail banking area; and 6) whether retail
deposit statements for bank customers also promote information on
the sale of uninsured debt obligations of the bank holding company
or a nonbank affiliate.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential abuses associated with the sale of holding
company obligations on the retail premises of affiliated
depository institutions has led to a number of legislative
proposals to prohibit this practice by statute.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such proposals
are currently under consideration by the Congress and may well be
enacted in the near future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the Federal depository
institution regulatory agencies are discussing the need for and
possible provisions of a regulation that would address the sale
and marketing of uninsured holding company obligations or bank
debt securities on the retail premises of affiliated depository
institutions.

This policy is not intended to preclude the sale of holding company affiliate obligations from a bank's money market desk, provided that the money market function is separate from any public area where retail deposits are accepted, including any lobby area.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref1">Return to text</a>
