&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Purpose and Scope</b>.&nbsp; The final rule adopting changes to Regulation Y<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
provides a streamlined process for reviewing proposals from well-run bank holding
companies under section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act (&quot;BHC Act&quot;). 
<b>See</b> section&nbsp;225.14 of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.14). &nbsp;These procedures reduce the
amount of information required to be provided by an applicant and permit the System
to take expedited action on proposals meeting the qualifying criteria set forth in the
regulation. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two important principles guided the revisions to Regulation Y and, in
particular, the development of the streamlined section 3 procedures. &nbsp;First, a well-run
bank holding company that meets objective and verifiable measures for each of the
criteria set forth in the regulation should be able to expect little burden or delay from
the approval process for relatively small or routine acquisitions unless special
circumstances demonstrate that a closer review is warranted. &nbsp;Second, the notice
process for relatively small or routine acquisitions should focus on an analysis of the
effects of the specific proposal and should not become a vehicle for comprehensively
evaluating and addressing supervisory and compliance issues that can be more
effectively addressed in the supervisory process. &nbsp;Accordingly, the review under the
streamlined procedures should focus on whether the qualifying criteria have been met. 
If, however, a proposal requires a closer review of any financial, managerial,
competitive, convenience and needs or other matter related to the factors in section 3
of the BHC Act, the proposal should be processed under the normal 30/60 day
procedures.<a href="#Footnote2" title="Footnote 2" name="Footref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streamlined section 3 procedures in section 225.14 of Regulation&nbsp;Y
may be followed in connection with applications to acquire shares, assets, or control of
a bank, or a merger or consolidation between bank holding companies.<a href="#Footnote3" title="Footnote 3" name="Footref3"><sup>3</sup></a>  The
streamlined section 3 procedures also may be followed in connection with notices to
acquire a savings association, provided that the proposal meets all the criteria for
expedited action as if the savings association were a bank.<a href="#Footnote4" title="Footnote 4" name="Footref4"><sup>4</sup></a><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter explains the requirements of the streamlined procedures, the
criteria that should be reviewed, and the information that must be provided by the
applicant. &nbsp;This letter also provides guidance for resolving various issues that may
arise under the streamlined section&nbsp;3 procedures.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals that require approval under both section 3 and section 4 of the
BHC Act should be processed under the applicable section 3 procedure (<i>i.e.</i>, either
the streamlined procedures or the normal 30/60 day procedures). &nbsp;The Reserve Bank
should notify the applicant in writing immediately after receipt of the application that
the section&nbsp;4 portion of the proposal will be processed under the section 3 procedures,
and should describe the nonbanking companies to be acquired in the <i>Federal&nbsp;Register</i>
notice.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be successful in reducing regulatory burden under the new
procedures, Reserve Bank and Board staffs should make every effort to determine as
early as possible whether a proposal qualifies for the streamlined procedure, and
whether an issue is raised that may warrant a more in-depth review of the proposal or
the institutions involved. &nbsp;The streamlined procedures clearly contemplate that any
proposal that meets the qualifying criteria may nevertheless be processed under the
normal 30/60 procedures if issues are raised. &nbsp;It is essential, however, that such
issues be identified early, and that once identified, the proposal quickly be transferred
to the 30/60 day procedures. &nbsp;The Reserve Banks are encouraged to discuss potential
issues and procedural questions with Board staff at the outset in reviewing proposals
under the streamlined procedures so that a determination may be made as soon as
practicable regarding whether the 30/60 day processing procedures should be used. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streamlined section 3 procedures continue the Board's policy of
publishing notice of a proposal for public comment. &nbsp;The time frame for acting on a
proposal under the procedures depends on the expiration of the public comment
period. &nbsp;It is therefore important that publication of the proposal be timely and accurate
in order for the streamlined procedures to be effective. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public comment period may also produce timely and substantive
written comments from interested persons. &nbsp;The final rule adopting Regulation Y
stated the Board's intent that the vast majority of comments which, prior to April 21,
1997, were considered by the Board would continue to be considered substantive and
would be reviewed under the 60 day procedure for Board action. &nbsp;Guidance on
determining when comments are timely and substantive is provided in this letter and in
a separate letter on protested applications. &nbsp;(<b>See</b> SR letter providing guidance on
protested proposals.)  As discussed in more detail in the guidance, Reserve Banks are
encouraged to consult with the Board's Legal Division if comments on a proposal are
received. <br>

<b><li>Qualifying Criteria</b>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streamlined procedures are available <b>only if</b> a proposal clearly meets
all of the following criteria.<a href="#Footnote5" title="Footnote 5" name="Footref5"><sup>5</sup></a><br>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<b><li>Financial criteria</b> -- The financial criteria must be met by the acquiring
bank holding company before <b>and</b> immediately after the proposed
transaction.<a href="#Footnote6" title="Footnote 6" name="Footref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><i>The acquiring bank holding company must be well-capitalized.</i><a href="#Footnote7" title="Footnote 7" name="Footref7"><sup>7</sup></a>
<p>
<i>Definition of well-capitalized</i> -- A bank holding company is well-capitalized for purposes of meeting the qualifying criteria if:&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;On a consolidated basis, the bank holding company
maintains a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0&nbsp;percent or more
and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0&nbsp;percent or more; and
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;The bank holding company is not subject to any written
agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action
directive issued by the Board to meet and maintain a specific
capital level for any capital measure. <br>
<p>
<i>Foreign banking organizations</i> -- The following standards apply for
determining whether a foreign banking organization is well-capitalized for purposes of meeting the qualifying criteria: <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;If the home country supervisor<a href="#Footnote8" title="Footnote 8" name="Footref8"><sup>8</sup></a> of a foreign banking
organization has adopted capital standards consistent in all
respects with the Capital Accord of the Basle Committee on
Banking Supervision (&quot;Basle Accord&quot;), the foreign banking
organization may: <br>
<p>
<ul>
(1) &nbsp;Calculate its capital ratios under the home country
standard; or <br>
<p>
(2) &nbsp;Calculate the capital ratios indicated above under the
well-capitalized standards applicable to a U.S. banking
organization. &nbsp;A foreign banking organization choosing this
option must apply all U.S. capital standards in all respects
and must consult with the Reserve Bank in advance to
ensure that sufficient information is provided in the notice to
verify compliance with U.S. capital standards.
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;If the home country supervisor has <b>not</b> adopted capital
standards consistent in all respects with the Basle Accord, the
foreign banking organization is considered well-capitalized only if
the foreign banking organization obtains a determination from the
Board, in advance of filing an application, that its capital is
equivalent to the capital that would be required for a U.S. banking
organization to be considered well-capitalized. &nbsp;These
determinations will be made on a case-by-case basis. &nbsp;Requests
by foreign banking organizations for such determinations should
be submitted in writing to the Director, Division of Banking
Supervision and Regulation. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) &nbsp;The regulation requires the provision of <i>pro forma</i>
financial information and capital ratios based on the most recent
quarter. &nbsp;Unless recent <b>existing</b> consolidated capital ratios are
provided by the foreign banking organization or are otherwise
available to the System, the Reserve Bank will need to estimate
the capital ratios of the foreign banking organization by using the
<i>pro forma</i> capital and balance sheet information that is to be
included in the application. &nbsp;In these instances, the Reserve Bank
should compare the financial information used in calculating the
capital ratios with the capital ratios reported by the foreign banking
organization in its most recent Y-7 submission and any other more
recent data available to the System. &nbsp;If the Reserve Bank believes
that the reported data and the data submitted in the application
may not accurately reflect the current consolidated capital position
of the foreign banking organization, the Reserve Bank may
request additional information. &nbsp;If the current consolidated capital
position of the foreign banking organization does not appear to
meet the well-capitalized criterion, the application should be
processed under the 30/60 day procedures. &nbsp; <br>
<p>
<i>Small bank holding companies</i> -- A bank holding company that, on
a <i>pro forma</i> basis, will continue to have consolidated assets of
less than $150&nbsp;million and that is subject to the Small Bank
Holding Company Policy Statement in Appendix C of Regulation&nbsp;Y
is well-capitalized for purposes of meeting the qualifying criteria if
it meets the requirements for expedited/waived processing
contained in the Policy Statement. &nbsp; <br>
<p>
<li><i>The lead insured depository institution of the acquiring bank
holding company must be well-capitalized.</i> <br>
<p>
<i>Definition of well-capitalized insured depository institution</i> -- An
insured depository institution is well-capitalized if the institution
maintains at least the capital levels required to be &quot;well-capitalized&quot; under the capital adequacy regulations or guidelines
applicable to the institution that have been adopted by the
appropriate federal banking agency (&quot;AFBA&quot;) for the institution.<a href="#Footnote9" title="Footnote 9" name="Footref9"><sup>9</sup></a> 
Unlike the definition of &quot;well-capitalized&quot; that applies to a bank
holding company, the definition applicable to insured depository
institutions typically includes a leverage component as well as
risk-based capital requirements. <br>
<p>
<i>Definition of lead insured depository institution</i> -- The lead insured
depository institution is the largest insured depository institution
controlled by the bank holding company as of the quarter ending
immediately prior to the proposed filing, based on a comparison of
the average total risk-weighted assets controlled during the
previous 12-month period by each insured depository institution
subsidiary of the holding company.<a href="#Footnote10" title="Footnote 10" name="Footref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <br>
<p>
<i>Foreign banking organizations</i> -- The following principles apply for
determining whether the lead insured depository institution for a
foreign banking organization is well-capitalized for purposes of
meeting the qualifying criteria: <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;A U.S. branch or agency of a foreign banking
organization is considered to be an insured depository institution. 
The lead insured depository institution for a foreign banking
organization that maintains branches (insured and uninsured),
agencies, and subsidiary insured depository institutions in the
United States is the individual branch, agency, or subsidiary
insured depository institution that is largest in terms of average
risk-weighted assets. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banking
organizations are not required to report assets on a risk-weighted
basis. &nbsp;If a foreign banking organization does not provide the
actual assets of its U.S. branches and agencies on a risk-weighted basis in its application, staff should employ the
conservative estimation methodology shown in the attachment to
this letter to identify the lead insured depository institution of the
foreign banking organization. &nbsp;In any instance where the
estimation methodology reveals a close determination, the
Reserve Bank should contact the foreign banking organization to
obtain more definitive information. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) &nbsp;A U.S. branch or agency of a foreign banking
organization is deemed to have the same capital ratios as the
consolidated foreign banking organization as determined under the
well-capitalized criterion discussed above. <br>
<p>
<li><i>Well-capitalized insured depository institutions must control at
least 80 percent of the aggregate total risk-weighted assets of
insured depository institutions controlled by the acquiring bank
holding company.</i> <br>
<p>
<i>Calculation of the 80 percent test -- </i>This test identifies insured
depository institutions that comprise 80&nbsp;percent of the risk-weighted assets held by insured depository institutions controlled
by the holding company. &nbsp;Nonbanking subsidiaries that are not
insured depository institutions are not included in calculating
compliance with this criterion. &nbsp;For example, a bank holding
company with one subsidiary bank that controls $8&nbsp;billion in risk-weighted assets, with six other subsidiary banks that each control
$200&nbsp;million in risk-weighted assets, and with uninsured
nonbanking subsidiaries with $8&nbsp;billion in risk-weighted assets
would qualify under this criterion if the $8&nbsp;billion bank is well-capitalized. <br>
<p>
<i>Foreign banking organizations</i> -- As noted above, all branches,
agencies and subsidiary insured depository institutions operated in
the United States by a foreign banking organization must be
considered in determining qualification under this criterion.<a href="#Footnote11" title="Footnote 11" name="Footref11"><sup>11</sup></a>  If the
Reserve Bank has concerns that this criterion is not satisfied using
the conservative estimation methodology in the attachment to this
letter, the Reserve Bank should contact the foreign banking
organization to obtain more definitive information. <br>
<p>
<li><i>No insured depository institution controlled by the acquiring bank
holding company or foreign banking organization may be
undercapitalized</i>. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Managerial criteria</b> -- The managerial criteria must be met at the time of
the transaction.<a href="#Footnote12" title="Footnote 12" name="Footref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><i>The acquiring bank holding company must be well-managed.</i> <br>
<p>
<i>Definition of well-managed</i> -- The acquiring bank holding company
must have received:&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a composite BOPEC rating of 1 or 2 at
the most recent inspection or subsequent review;<a href="#Footnote13" title="Footnote 13" name="Footref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <b>and</b> (b)&nbsp;a
satisfactory rating for management and for compliance, where
these ratings are given. <br>
<p>
<i>Foreign banking organizations</i> -- A foreign banking organization is
deemed to be well-managed if the combined operations of the
foreign banking organization in the United States have received a
rating of 1 or 2 (derived from the Summary of Condition) at the
most recent annual assessment. &nbsp; <br>
<p>
If a bank holding company or a foreign banking organization has
not received a rating, see the guidance provided in
paragraph&nbsp;(B)(5) below. <br>
<p>
<li><i>The lead insured depository institution of the acquiring bank
holding company must be well-managed.</i><a href="#Footnote14" title="Footnote 14" name="Footref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <br>
<p>
At its most recent examinations for safety and soundness and
consumer compliance or subsequent review by the AFBA, the
lead insured depository institution must have received:&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;a
composite rating of 1 or 2; <b>and</b> (b) at least a satisfactory rating for
management and for consumer compliance, where these ratings
are given. <br>
<p>
<i>Foreign banking organizations</i> -- The U.S. branch or agency of a
foreign banking organization that meets the lead insured
depository institution test must have received:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;A supervisory composite rating of 1 or 2 under the
ROCA rating system;  <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;A compliance rating of 1 or 2 (<i>i.e.</i>, the &quot;C&quot; component
in the ROCA rating must be a 1 or 2); <b>and</b> <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) &nbsp;A consumer compliance rating of 1 or 2, where these
ratings are given. <br>
<p>
<li><i>Insured depository institutions that control at least 80 percent of
the total risk-weighted assets of insured depository institutions
controlled by the acquiring bank holding company must be well-managed.</i> <br>
<p>
The 80&nbsp;percent test for the well-managed criteria should be
calculated in the same manner as discussed in paragraph (A)(3)
above for the well-capitalized criteria. <br>
<p>
At the most recent examinations for safety and soundness and
consumer compliance or subsequent reviews by the AFBA, the
insured depository institutions must have received:&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a
composite rating of 1 or 2; <b>and</b> (b) at least a satisfactory rating for
management and for consumer compliance, where these ratings
are given. &nbsp; <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Foreign banking organizations</i> -- U.S. branches and agencies of a
foreign banking organization included in the 80 percent test must
have received:<a href="#Footnote15" title="Footnote 15" name="Footref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Supervisory composite ratings of 1 or 2 under the
ROCA rating system;  <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;Compliance ratings of 1 or 2 (<i>i.e.</i>, the &quot;C&quot; component in
the ROCA rating must be a 1 or 2); <b>and</b> <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) &nbsp;Consumer compliance ratings of 1 or 2, where these
ratings are given. <br>
<p>
As noted above, all branches, agencies and subsidiary insured
depository institutions operated in the United States by a foreign
banking organization must be considered in determining
qualification under this criterion.<a href="#Footnote16" title="Footnote 16" name="Footref16"><sup>16</sup></a>  If the Reserve Bank has
concerns that this criterion is not satisfied using the conservative
estimation methodology in the attachment to this letter, the
Reserve Bank should contact the foreign banking organization to
obtain more definitive information. <br>
<p>
<li><i>No insured depository institution controlled by the acquiring bank
holding company may have received one of the two lowest
composite ratings at the later of the institution's most recent safety
and soundness examination or subsequent review by the AFBA
for the institution.</i> <br>
<p>
There is one <b>exception</b> to this criterion.<br>
<p>
Any insured depository institution that has been acquired by the
bank holding company during the 12 month period preceding the
date on which the application is filed may be excluded from this
criterion (but not from the 80&nbsp;percent criterion in paragraph&nbsp;(B)(3)
above) if: &nbsp;(a)&nbsp;the bank holding company has developed a plan
acceptable to the AFBA for the insured depository institution to
restore the capital and management of the institution; and (b) all
insured depository institutions that are excluded, in the aggregate,
control less than 10 percent of the aggregate total risk-weighted
assets of all insured depository institutions controlled by the
acquiring bank holding company. <br>
<p>
<li><i>If a company or insured depository institution has not received an
inspection or examination rating, the Reserve Bank, in
consultation with Board staff and based on all available
information, may determine whether the organization is well-managed.</i> <br>
<p>
Applying the well-managed criterion in the absence of an
inspection or examination rating requires the exercise of
reasonable discretion in light of all available information. &nbsp;For
example, the Reserve Bank could reasonably conclude, in the
absence of any adverse information, that a shell bank holding with
no debt or activities is well-managed if its subsidiary bank is
deemed to be well-managed and in satisfactory financial condition. 
The Reserve Bank also could support a determination that a
newly formed organization is well-managed if management's prior
record at other insured depository institutions is satisfactory. &nbsp; <br>
<p>
In consulting with Board staff, the Reserve Bank should provide
information supporting its position as to whether the organization
should be considered well-managed. &nbsp;This should be done as
early in the processing period as possible. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Convenience and needs criteria</b>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>
<i>The record must indicate that the proposed transaction would
meet the convenience and needs of the community standard in
section 3 of the BHC Act.</i> <br>
<p>
This criterion is intended to encompass the same type of review
conducted by Reserve Banks of the convenience and needs factor
in delegated cases considered under the 30 day procedure. <br>
<p>
For example, the Reserve Bank should consider the Community
Reinvestment Act (&quot;CRA&quot;) ratings of the organizations involved in
the transaction and, in the case of an interstate transaction, the
applicant's record of compliance with applicable state community
reinvestment laws. &nbsp;In addition, the Reserve Bank should weigh
information provided by the applicant, and other information
available to the System, in considering the effect of the transaction
on the convenience and needs of the community. &nbsp; <br>
<p>
As part of this review, the Reserve Bank also must consider the
information provided by the applicant regarding steps taken to
improve the CRA performance of subsidiaries that have received
less than satisfactory ratings. &nbsp;The amount of information the
applicant should provide in the application will depend on the
nature of the matters to be addressed. &nbsp;The review also should
assure the Reserve Bank that the relevant institutions are working
with the AFBA to address weaknesses. &nbsp; <br>
<p>
A proposal by an applicant that has a history of less than
satisfactory CRA performance, such as two or more consecutive
&quot;needs to improve&quot; ratings at one insured depository institution or
alternating &quot;needs to improve&quot; ratings at several institutions, may
warrant review under the 30/60 day procedures. <br>
<p>
If the applicant proposes to acquire an insured depository
institution with less than satisfactory CRA ratings, the Reserve
Bank should consider any steps to be taken by the applicant to
address weaknesses in the CRA performance record of the target
institution. <br>
<p>
<li><i>CRA ratings -- At the time of the transaction, the lead insured
depository institution</i><a href="#Footnote17" title="Footnote 17" name="Footref17"><sup>17</sup></a><i> of the acquiring bank holding company and
insured depository institutions that control at least 80&nbsp;percent of
the total risk-weighted assets of insured institutions controlled by
the holding company must have received satisfactory or better
composite ratings at their most recent examinations under the
CRA.</i> <br>
<p>
The 80&nbsp;percent test for the CRA criteria should be calculated in
the same manner as discussed in paragraph (A)(3) above for the
well-capitalized criteria. <br>
<p>
<i>Foreign banking organizations</i> -- A U.S. branch or agency of a
foreign banking organization receives a CRA rating, and therefore
is counted for purposes of this provision, only if it is an FDIC-insured branch in accordance with section 6 of the International
Banking Act or a branch subject to CRA requirements as a result
of an interstate acquisition under section 107(f) of the Riegle-Neal
Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Competitive criteria</b> <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><i>HHI and deposit screen</i> -- <i>Without regard to any divestitures
proposed by the acquiring bank holding company, the acquisition
may not cause the insured depository institutions controlled by the
acquiring bank holding company to control in excess of 35&nbsp;percent
of market deposits in any relevant banking market, or the
Herfindahl-Hirschman index to increase by more than 200 points
in any relevant banking market with a post-acquisition index of at
least 1800.</i> <br>
<p>
The competitive criteria are not intended to alter the scope of
review currently conducted by the Reserve Bank under delegated
authority for section 3 proposals other than to require that the
transaction meet the screens without consideration of divestitures. 
The Reserve Bank should consult with Board staff on issues
regarding the relevant market or the competitive effects of a
proposal. &nbsp;Transactions involving a divestiture should be reviewed
under the 30/60 day procedures. <br>
<p>
<li><i>Department of Justice (&quot;DOJ&quot;)</i> review -- In addition, the DOJ must
not have indicated to the Board that consummation of the
transaction is likely to have a significantly adverse effect on
competition in any relevant banking market. <br>
<p>
The Reserve Bank should consult with Board staff to determine
whether the DOJ has any objections to the proposal, and whether
the proposal will be subject to the 15 or 30 day waiting period. &nbsp;If
the DOJ has not made its determination by the time System action
is required, the Reserve Bank may approve the proposal, subject
to the 30 day waiting period. &nbsp; <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Size of acquisition criteria</b>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><i>Limited growth</i> -- In the case of an acquisition, the sum of the
aggregate risk-weighted assets to be acquired in the proposal and
the aggregate risk-weighted assets acquired by the acquiring bank
holding company in all transactions approved during the previous
12&nbsp;months under the streamlined procedures governing
acquisitions of banks (section 225.14) and the streamlined
procedures governing acquisitions of nonbanking companies
(section 225.23) may not exceed 35&nbsp;percent of the consolidated
risk-weighted assets of the acquiring bank holding company at the
beginning of the 12&nbsp;month period. <br>
<p>
Transactions that were approved under the 30/60 day procedures
are excluded in calculating compliance with the criterion. &nbsp;The 12
month period is a rolling period that looks back from the date that
each notice/application is filed under the streamlined procedures
and is not restarted from the date that a transaction is approved
under the 30/60 day procedures. <br>
<p>
<i>Small bank holding companies</i> -- The 35 percent limitation does
not apply if, immediately following consummation of the proposed
transaction, the consolidated risk-weighted assets of the acquiring
bank holding company are less than $300&nbsp;million. <br>
<p>
<li><i>Size limitation on individual transactions -- The total risk-weighted
assets that the holding company proposes to acquire may not
exceed $7.5 billion.</i> <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Other qualifying criteria</b> <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><i>No supervisory actions</i> -- <i>During the 12 month period ending on
the date on which the bank holding company proposes to
consummate the proposed transaction, no formal administrative
order, including a written agreement, cease and desist order,
capital directive, prompt corrective action directive, asset
maintenance agreement, or other formal enforcement action is or
was outstanding against the bank holding company or any insured
depository institution subsidiary of the holding company, and no
formal administrative enforcement proceeding involving any such
enforcement action, order, or directive is or was pending.</i>   <br>
<p>
An administrative enforcement action is outstanding once it is
issued or executed. &nbsp;An administrative enforcement proceeding is
pending during the period if the bank holding company or insured
depository institution is considering agreeing to the formal action
or is seeking to contest the issuance of an order or to appeal an
already issued order. &nbsp;The Reserve Bank should consult with the
appropriate AFBA of the insured depository institution as needed
to confirm compliance with this criterion. <br>
<p>
This criterion focuses on formal actions, and a bank holding
company is not automatically disqualified based on an informal
action, such as a memorandum of understanding or letter
agreement. &nbsp;The Reserve Bank or Board may, nonetheless, notify
a bank holding company that the 30/60 day procedures should be
followed if the circumstances surrounding a memorandum of
understanding, letter agreement, or other informal action indicate
that more in-depth review of the proposal, or applicant or company
involved, is warranted. <br>
<p>
<li><i>The proposal must be permissible under the informational
sufficiency or comprehensive home country supervision standards
set forth in section 3(c)(3) of the BHC Act.</i>  <br>
<p>
The Reserve Bank should consult with Board staff, as necessary,
to confirm that the Board has previously determined that the
foreign banking organization is subject to comprehensive
supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by its home
country supervisor. &nbsp;If the foreign banking organization has not
been the subject of a consolidated supervision determination by
the Board, the proposal must be processed under the 60 day
procedures. <br>
<p>
<li><i>The proposal must be permissible under the interstate banking
provisions set forth in section 3(d) of the BHC Act.</i>
<p>
Reserve Bank staff should prepare an analysis of the laws of the
relevant states and consult with the Board's Legal Division if an
interstate acquisition or merger for the particular states involved in
the proposal has not been previously approved. &nbsp;The analysis
should take into consideration national and state deposit
limitations and state minimum age requirements. &nbsp;As noted above,
section 3(d) also requires consideration of the applicant's
compliance with state community reinvestment laws. <br>
<p>
<li><i>The Board or appropriate Reserve Bank has received no timely
and substantive written comment other than a comment that
supports approval of the proposal.</i> <br>
<p>
A timely and substantive written comment other than a comment
supporting approval would require that the proposal be processed
under the 60 day procedure. &nbsp;An untimely or nonsubstantive
comment would not ordinarily disqualify the proposal from the
streamlined procedures.<a href="#Footnote18" title="Footnote 18" name="Footref18"><sup>18</sup></a>   <br>
<p>
A comment is timely if, on or before the last day in the comment
period, it is (a)&nbsp;mailed first class, properly addressed, and
postmarked, (b) entered into an express delivery system for the
proper destination, or (c)&nbsp;received by the Board or Reserve Bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
A comment generally is considered substantive unless it relates to
individual customer complaints, previously decided issues, minority
shareholder rights issues, frivolous or unsubstantiated claims, or
issues that are not related to factors in section 3 of the BHC Act
that could be reviewed by the Reserve Banks. &nbsp;<b>See</b> SR letter on
protested proposals for guidance in identifying, reviewing, and
responding to these types of comments.
<p>
<li><i>The Board or Reserve Bank has not notified the acquiring bank
holding company, before action is required under the streamlined
procedures, that an application is required to permit closer review
of any financial, managerial, competitive, convenience and needs,
or other matters related to the statutory factors that the Board
must consider.</i> <br>
<p>
This criterion underscores a key aspect of the streamlined
procedures, which is the recognition that a proposal can meet all
of the qualifying criteria and nevertheless require a closer review
under the 30/60 day procedures. &nbsp;For example, an issue may be
raised if the acquiring bank holding company has experienced
significant problems absorbing recent acquisitions. &nbsp;Information
from the AFBA  or the home country supervisor of a foreign
banking organization may raise issues regarding the financial or
managerial strength of the organization that are not reflected in
the organization's most recent rating. &nbsp;In addition, other
information available to the System may warrant a closer review of
an organization or individual involved in the proposal. &nbsp;Moreover,
the structure of a transaction may raise a novel interpretative or
policy issue under the BHC Act or may be the first proposal
considered under a new law. <br>
<p>
If any issue is raised by a proposal that requires a closer review,
the application should be processed under the 30/60 day
procedures. &nbsp;Identifying these issues early in the process will
preserve the goals of the streamlined procedures without imposing
an undue burden on the applicant.
</ol>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Procedures</b>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<b><li>Filing Requirements</b> -- An application under the streamlined procedures
must be in writing, and contain the information listed below. &nbsp;An
application is deemed to be &quot;filed&quot; with the Reserve Bank the day it is
received if received during normal business hours, or the next business
day if received after normal business hours. &nbsp;The applicant should
ensure that non-public information is provided in the confidential portion
of the proposal. &nbsp;In light of the expedited nature of the streamlined
procedures, draft applications should not be accepted. <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><i>Certification that all criteria are met</i> -- The form of certification may
be a single sentence in the application in which the applicant
certifies that all the criteria in section 225.14 of Regulation Y (12
CFR 225.14) are satisfied. &nbsp;The certification may be provided by
anyone with knowledge and authority to bind the acquiring bank
holding company, including legal counsel for or executive officers
of the acquiring holding company. &nbsp;Certification by the board of
directors of the holding company is acceptable, but not necessary. 
<p>
<li><i>Description of, and parties to, the transaction</i> -- The description
should include identification of the companies involved, the
banking markets affected, the structure of the transaction, and any
changes in the corporate structure of the applicant that are
expected to result from the transaction. &nbsp;If the proposal involves
the acquisition of a savings association eligible for processing
under these procedures, the applicant also should provide a
description of the activities conducted by the savings association
and its subsidiaries. &nbsp;This information should be reviewed to
determined whether the activities of the savings association are
consistent with the BHC Act. <br>
<p>
<li><i>Convenience and needs information -- </i>The bank holding company
must provide a description of the effect of the transaction on the
convenience and needs of the communities to be served. &nbsp;In
addition, if any insured depository institution subsidiary does not
have at least a satisfactory CRA performance rating at the time of
the transaction, the bank holding company must provide a
description of the actions being taken to improve the CRA
performance of the insured depository institution(s). &nbsp;A bank
holding company may satisfy this latter requirement by providing
copies of information prepared for the AFBA  of the relevant
institution, or by providing copies or summaries of responsive
documents that were originally prepared for other purposes. <br>
<p>
<li><i>Evidence of publication</i> -- The acquiring bank holding company
must provide evidence that notice of the proposal has been
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the form and
locations specified in section 262.3 of Regulation Y (12 CFR
262.3) and containing the information specified in section&nbsp;225.16
of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.16). <br>
<p>
The newspaper notice must be published no more than
15&nbsp;calendar days before and no later than 7 calendar days
following the date that the application is filed with the appropriate
Reserve Bank. &nbsp; <br>
<p>
All proposals will be published in the <i>Federal&nbsp;Register</i> and listed in
the Board's new publication for acquisitions proposals (the H.2A). 
The acquiring bank holding company may request advanced
publication in the <i>Federal&nbsp;Register</i> as discussed in paragraph&nbsp;(D)
below. &nbsp; <br>
<p>
<li><i>Financial information</i> <br>
<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>If the acquiring bank holding company has consolidated
assets of <b>$150&nbsp;million or more</b>, the bank holding company
must provide: <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>An abbreviated consolidated <i>pro forma</i> balance
sheet as of the most recent quarter showing credit
and debit adjustments that reflect the proposed
transaction; <br>
<p>
<li>Consolidated <i>pro forma</i> risk-based capital ratios for
the acquiring bank holding company as of the most
recent quarter; and  <br>
<p>
<li>A description of the purchase price and the terms
and sources of funding for the transaction. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<li>If the acquiring bank holding company has consolidated
assets of <b>less than $150&nbsp;million</b>, the bank holding company
must provide: <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>A <i>pro forma</i> parent-only balance sheet as of the
most recent quarter showing credit and debit
adjustments that reflect the proposed transaction; <br>
<p>
<li>A description of the purchase price, the terms and
sources of funding for the transaction; and <br>
<p>
<li>The sources and schedule for retiring any debt
incurred in the transaction. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<li><i>Pro forma</i> total-risk-weighted assets, total assets, Tier 1
capital, and total capital for each insured depository
institution whose total risk-weighted assets, total assets,
Tier 1 capital or total capital would change upon
consummation of the proposal. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<li><i>Director and senior executive officer information</i> -- If the acquiring
bank holding company has <b>consolidated assets of less than
$300&nbsp;million</b>, the holding company must provide a list of and
biographical information regarding any directors or senior
executive officers of the resulting bank holding company that are
not directors or senior executive offices of the acquiring bank
holding company or of a company or institution to be acquired.<a href="#Footnote19" title="Footnote 19" name="Footref19"><sup>19</sup></a>   <br>
<p>
This information should be reviewed to determine whether those
individuals are known to banking for purposes of assessing
managerial factors, and may indicate a need to conduct name
checks. <br>
<p>
<li><i>Competitive information</i> -- The acquiring bank holding company
must provide the market indexes for each relevant banking market
reflecting the <i>pro</i> <i>forma</i> effect on competition resulting from the
transaction. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Waiver of unnecessary information</b> -- The Reserve Bank may reduce
the financial and managerial and competitive information requirements in
paragraphs (A)(5), (6), and (7) above  if the information is clearly not
needed to assess compliance with the qualifying criteria. &nbsp;For example, a
waiver of some of the financial information may be granted if the size
and scope of a proposed transaction is clearly insignificant relative to the
size and scope of the acquiring bank holding company's existing
operations. &nbsp;Waivers of information do not need to be made in writing,
though it is advisable that the Reserve Banks document the reasons for
granting the waivers. &nbsp;If information is waived, the Reserve Bank must
assure that information is contained in the record (<i>e.g.</i>, the same
information was obtained from another source, the information was
already obtained by the Reserve Bank from the applicant in a previous
transaction, or sufficient alternate information was provided by applicant)
to assure that the qualifying criteria can be verified. <br>
<p>
<b><li>Additional information for Change in Bank Control Act (&quot;CIBC Act&quot;)
notices</b> -- In some cases, a bank holding company acquisition may
result in a person or group of persons acquiring control of the bank
holding company for purposes of the CIBC Act. &nbsp;Any person or group of
persons proposing to acquire control of the acquiring bank holding
company for purposes of the CIBC Act or section&nbsp;225.41 of Regulation Y
(12 CFR 225.41) may fulfill the notice requirements of the CIBC Act and
section 225.43 of Regulation Y (12&nbsp;CFR 225.43) by providing, as part of
the section 3 application by the bank holding company, identifying and
biographical information required in paragraph (6)(A) of the CIBC Act (12
USC &#167;&nbsp;1817(j)(6)(A)), as well as any financial or other information
required by the Reserve Bank under section 225.43 of Regulation Y (12
CFR 225.43). &nbsp;See forthcoming supervisory letter regarding revisions to
Regulation Y that relate to the Change in Bank Control Act. &nbsp; <br>
<p>
A person or group of persons that chooses not to provide this information
as part of the section 3 filing must separately comply with the prior notice
requirements under the CIBC Act. &nbsp;In these cases, the Reserve Bank
should notify the applicant of this requirement and the potential impact
on the ability of applicant to consummate its proposal in a timely fashion. 
If it appears that an issue would be raised by the filing of a CIBC Act
notice by the persons involved, the Reserve Bank should notify the
applicant that the transaction will be reviewed under the 30/60 day
procedures. <br>
<p>
<b><li>Advance <i>Federal&nbsp;Register</i> publication</b> -- The applicant may request
that, during the 15 day period prior to filing a notice, the Board publish
notice of its proposal in the <i>Federal&nbsp;Register</i>. &nbsp;A request for advance
publication must be in writing and provide all relevant information
prescribed by the Board for <i>Federal Register</i> publication, and the
requested publication date. <br>
<p>
Because notice of the application may be <b>published</b> up to 15 days prior
to filing, and it usually takes 7 <b>business</b> days to process a request for
publication, applicants may submit requests for publication in advance of
the requested publication date. &nbsp;<b>See</b> forthcoming supervisory letter
regarding publication of bank holding company and change in control
applications and notices. &nbsp;The Reserve Bank should verify receipt by the
Board's Legal Division of a <i>Federal&nbsp;Register</i> notice in advance of filing. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Reserve Bank Processing</b> <br>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<b><li>Receipt of application</b> -- When an application is filed under the
streamlined procedures, the Reserve Bank should immediately on receipt
forward two copies of the application to the Board's Clearing Unit, and
the proposed <i>Federal&nbsp;Register</i> notice to the Board's Legal Division
(unless previously forwarded in advance of filing). &nbsp;See SR letter
regarding procedures for making regulatory filings available to
requesters. &nbsp;Because proposals to be acted on by the Secretary of the
Board are eligible for processing under the streamlined procedures, the
Reserve Bank should indicate in its transmission to the Clearing Unit
when a proposal will require processing by Board staff. <br>
<p>
In addition, within the first business day following receipt, the Reserve
Bank should: <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>Provide notice of the proposal, including a copy of the filing, to the
<b>primary banking supervisor</b> of the insured depository institution(s)
to be acquired.<a href="#Footnote20" title="Footnote 20" name="Footref20"><sup>20</sup></a>  Such notice should indicate that the primary
banking supervisor has 30 calendar days from the date of the
letter giving notice (or such shorter time as agreed to by the
primary banking supervisor) in which to comment. &nbsp;Because of
potential delay if there is an objection, the Reserve Bank should
contact the primary banking supervisor whenever possible prior to
the end of processing to determine whether the supervisor intends
to comment on the proposal. <br>
<p>
<li>Provide notice of the proposal, including a copy of the filing, to the
DOJ, requiring acknowledgement of receipt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<p>
</ol>
<b><li>Determination that criteria are met</b><br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><i>Determining that criteria are met</i> -- Promptly following receipt of a
notice for streamlined processing, staff should determine, based
on information available to the System, whether all of the
qualifying criteria are met. &nbsp;Even if the bank holding company
meets the qualifying criteria for expedited processing, the Reserve
Bank may nevertheless require the filing of an application under
the 30/60 day process if the proposal raises a supervisory,
competitive, legal, or other issue as discussed above that warrants
in-depth review. &nbsp; <br>
<p>
<li><i>Failure to meet qualifying criteria</i> -- If the application does not
meet the qualifying criteria, or if it raises a supervisory,
competitive, legal or other concern, an application under the 30/60
day procedures is required. &nbsp;In this case, the Reserve Bank
should notify the bank holding company in writing (and by
telephone if appropriate) as soon as possible that an application
under the 30/60 day procedures will be required. &nbsp;The notice
should provide the same information that is currently provided to
applicants when applications are transferred from delegated action
to Board action. <br>
<p>
For applications that have been transferred from the streamlined
to the 30/60 day processing schedule, Reserve Bank and Board
staff should determine whether information from the applicant
supplementing the streamlined filing is necessary to address
relevant issues. &nbsp;Reserve Bank or Board staff may request the
additional information at the time the applicant is notified of the
processing change, or at any time during the processing period. <br>
<p>
The proposal shall be considered to have been accepted under
the 30/60 day procedures as of the date that the original
application was filed under the streamlined procedures. <br>
<p>
<li><i>Incomplete applications</i> -- The Reserve Bank may return an
application as incomplete within 3&nbsp;business days of filing if the
application does not contain all the information required by
Regulation Y for notices under the streamlined procedures. <br>
<p>
<li><i>Supplemental information</i> -- In general, the acquiring bank holding
company will not be expected to provide additional information to
ensure that the qualifying criteria are satisfied, other than the
information required above. &nbsp;If, however, the Reserve Bank
determines that more information is necessary to determine
whether the application meets the qualifying criteria, the Reserve
Bank may make a specific request for supporting information. &nbsp;It is
expected that such requests would be rare, and that processing
under the expedited time periods in the streamlined procedures
generally would not be tolled, even with the consent of the
applicant.
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Extension of the comment period</b> <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><i>Requests for extension of comment period</i> -- The Board (but not
the Reserve Banks) may either grant or deny a written request by
a particular commenter to extend the comment period. &nbsp;In
particular, the Board may grant an extension of up to 15 days to a
requester that has made a timely request for an application that
has not been made available, and will grant a joint request by an
interested member of the public for an extension for a reasonable
period of time for a purpose related to the section 3 factors. &nbsp;The
Reserve Bank should send all requests to the Board's Legal
Division immediately on receipt. <br>
<p>
In considering a request for an extension, the Board will consider
the specific reasons given by the requester for being unable to file
a timely comment. &nbsp;For example, if a requester contends that
more time is required to analyze a proposal, the Board will take
into account when the proposal was announced, when the
regulatory filing was made available to the public, and when the
request for the regulatory filing was made. &nbsp;Delays beyond the
time normally provided in&nbsp;answering a timely and reasonable
request for publicly-available information or in providing
information in response to timely comments or the System's
request for information also will be considered in determining
whether to grant an extension of the comment period. <br>
<p>
Applicants also are expected to provide responses to requests for
information in accordance with the Board's Rules of Procedures. <br>
<p>
<li><i>Effect of extension of comment period</i> -- An extension of the
comment period would not disqualify an otherwise qualifying
proposal from consideration under the streamlined procedures. 
That is, the Reserve Bank may act on a proposal under the
streamlined procedures within 3 to 5 business days after close of
an extended comment period if all of the criteria for expedited
processing are met at the time action is taken. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Action on proposals within 3 to 5 business days after comment
period</b> <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><i>Action required</i> -- Within 5 business days after the close of the
public comment period, the Board or the appropriate Reserve
Bank must act on a proposal or notify the bank holding company
that an application under the 30/60 day procedures is required. 
The Board or Reserve Bank may not approve any proposal prior
to the third business day following the close of the public comment
period, unless an emergency exists that requires expedited or
immediate action. &nbsp;In exceptional circumstances, the Reserve
Bank may need additional time for acting on a notice. &nbsp;The Board
(but not the Reserve Banks) may extend the period for action by
up to 5&nbsp;business days. &nbsp;The Reserve Bank should contact Board
staff <b>immediately</b> in such instances. <br>
<p>
<li><i>Approval letter</i> -- The Reserve Bank should include the following
information in its approval letter to the applicant: <br>
<p>
<ol type=a>
<li><i>Waiting period</i> -- Consummation of an approved transaction
under the expedited procedures is subject to the applicable
15- or 30-day waiting period for antitrust review. <br>
<p>
<li><i>Conditional approval</i> -- Approval of the transaction is
subject to the condition that the primary banking supervisor
not recommend in writing to the Board disapproval of the
proposal prior to the end of the 30-day supervisory
comment period. &nbsp;If the primary banking supervisor
recommends such disapproval before the expiration of the
comment period, any approval given by the Reserve Bank
or the Board shall be revoked and, if required by section
3(b) of the BHC Act, the Board will order a hearing. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each bank holding company, including a foreign banking organization, is
responsible for certifying compliance with the requirement that the company and
insured depository institutions controlled by the company are well-capitalized and
well-managed. &nbsp;If a foreign banking organization does not provide the actual assets of
its U.S. branches and agencies on a risk-weighted basis in its application, the Reserve
Bank should use the conservative estimation methodology, discussed below, to
estimate the risk-weighted assets of such institutions. &nbsp;In performing these calculations
for U.S. branches and agencies, the Reserve Bank should review existing in-house
data filed by the foreign banking organization (<i>i.e.</i>, FFIEC 031, 032, 033, 034, and/or
002 reports). &nbsp;If the results of the Reserve Bank's calculations using those data and
methodology reveal a close determination, the Reserve Bank should contact the
foreign banking organization to obtain more definitive information.<br>

<p>
<a name="Footnote4">4.</a>&nbsp; A bank holding company acquiring other insured depository institutions, such as trust companies and credit card banks that do not meet the definition of &quot;bank&quot; under the BHC Act, must file under section 4, but may elect to follow the section 3 streamlined procedures in section 225.14 of Regulation Y if it meets all the criteria applicable as if the acquired institution were a bank. &nbsp;A bank holding company may also continue to have proposals to acquire savings associations and other nonbank insured depository institutions processed under the 30/60 day procedures in section&nbsp;225.24 of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.24) for nonbanking acquisitions.&nbsp; Proposals to acquire nonbank insured depository institutions are not eligible for the streamlined section 4 procedures for nonbanking acquisitions in section 225.23 of Regulation Y (12&nbsp;CFR 225.23).&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref4">Return to text</a>

<p>
<a name="Footnote5">5.</a>&nbsp; If an acquiring bank holding company is part of a chain banking organization, the criteria for the streamlined procedures will generally apply only to the bank holding company making the acquisition. &nbsp;There may be circumstances, however, when it is appropriate to evaluate the proposal in light of the entire organization. &nbsp;For example, the overall financial condition of the chain organization may require a closer review of the financial aspects of the proposal under the 30/60 day procedures. &nbsp;In such cases, the Reserve Bank should consult with Board staff on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref5">Return to text</a>

<a name="Footnote7">7.</a>&nbsp; A bank holding company must meet the well-capitalized criterion on a <b>consolidated</b> basis. &nbsp;The well-capitalized bank holding company criterion generally will not apply to intermediate-tier bank holding companies involved in the transaction, although the 30/60 day procedures may be used if there are concerns about the financial strength of an intermediate-tier bank holding company.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref7">Return to text</a>
