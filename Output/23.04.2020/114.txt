<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk Management 
   and Valuation of Mortgage Servicing Assets Arising 
   from Mortgage Banking Activities</div>
<p>The Federal Reserve, along with the Office of the 
   Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit 
   Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision 
   (the agencies), issued the attached <i>Interagency 
   Advisory on Mortgage Banking</i>.&nbsp; The advisory 
   highlights various supervisory concerns regarding 
   the valuation and hedging of mortgage servicing assets 
   (MSAs) and similar mortgage banking assets.&nbsp; 
   It also provides supervisory guidance on sound risk 
   management practices regarding valuation and modeling 
   processes, management information systems, and internal 
   audit as applied to mortgage banking activities. 
</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Background</div>
<p>The findings of recent examinations at some banking 
   organizations that engage in mortgage banking and 
   mortgage servicing activities suggest the need for 
   enhanced rigor in the specification and documentation 
   of the underlying assumptions, models, and modeling 
   processes used to value MSAs. The need for improvement 
   in specific areas varies by institution and depends 
   to a large extent on the materiality of the positions 
   involved.</p>
<p>In particular, some institutions may need more rigorous 
   processes for validating their MSA valuation models 
   and underlying model assumptions, incorporating available 
   market data in their valuations, amortizing remaining 
   MSA&nbsp;cost bases, and evaluating MSAs&nbsp;for 
   impairment. In addition, some institutions may require 
   more robust processes in adequately characterizing, 
   supporting the inclusion of, and estimating certain 
   benefits of mortgage servicing activities as ancillary 
   income. Some institutions also may need to enhance 
   the risk management controls surrounding their mortgage 
   banking operations and MSAs. Such improvements may 
   entail greater segregation of duties between valuation, 
   hedging, and accounting functions, and greater consistencies 
   in the assumptions used for valuing, hedging, and 
   pricing in mortgage-related activities. </p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Risk Management Guidance</div>
<p>As set forth in the attached guidance, the agencies 
   expect institutions to conduct all aspects of their 
   mortgage-banking operations in a safe and sound manner 
   and consistent with sound risk management practices. 
   Institutions are expected to take into account the 
   potential exposure of both earnings and capital to 
   changes in mortgage banking assets and operations 
   under expected and stressed market conditions. The 
   practices advanced in the interagency advisory supplement 
   and expand upon existing Federal&nbsp;Reserve supervisory 
   guidance on interest rate risk management, mortgage-banking, 
   and financial modeling.<a href="#Footnote1" 
   name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>In general, management should ensure that detailed 
   policies, procedures, and limits are in place to 
   monitor and control mortgage banking activities, 
   including loan production, pipeline (unclosed loans), 
   and warehouse (closed loans) administration, secondary 
   market transactions, servicing operations, and management 
   (including hedging) of MSAs. Institutions are expected 
   to have comprehensive documentation that adequately 
   substantiates and validates both the carrying values 
   of their MSAs and the underlying assumptions used 
   to derive these values. Institutions should have 
   documented analyses and processes that adequately 
   support the amortization and timely recognition of 
   impairment of their MSAs. </p>
<p>Management information reports should provide comprehensive 
   and accurate information on the institution's mortgage 
   banking operations and MSAs. Senior management and 
   the board should be aware of and focus on key risks, 
   profitability and accounting and valuation practices. 
   Given the risks inherent in these activities, internal 
   auditors should review the risks of and controls 
   over an institution's mortgage banking operations 
   on an on-going basis. </p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Scope and Applicability </div>
<p>The attached guidance applies to the mortgage banking 
   activities conducted by state member banks, bank 
   holding companies, Edge corporations and U.S. branches 
   and agencies of foreign banks.<a href="#Footnote2" 
   name="Footref2"><sup>2</sup></a> This guidance builds 
   on, supports, and is fully consistent with existing 
   guidance on risk management issued by the Federal&nbsp;Reserve.<a href="#Footnote3" 
   name="Footref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>This letter and the attached interagency guidance 
   developed jointly by the agencies should be distributed 
   to state member banks, bank holding companies, and 
   foreign banking organizations supervised by the Federal&nbsp;Reserve.
