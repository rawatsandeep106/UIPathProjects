THE FEDERAL RESERVE</div>
<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending</div>
<p>On June 29, 2007, the Federal Reserve and the other federal financial institutions regulatory agencies&nbsp;(the
   agencies) issued the attached final <i>Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending</i> (<i>Subprime Statement</i>)
   to address issues and questions related to certain adjustable-rate mortgage&nbsp;(ARM) products marketed
   to subprime borrowers. This statement applies to all banks and their subsidiaries and bank holding
companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. The attachment provides the <i>Subprime Statement</i>. </p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Scope</div>
<p>The <i>Subprime Statement</i> emphasizes the need for prudent underwriting standards and clear and
   balanced consumer information so that institutions and consumers can assess the risks arising from
   certain ARM products with discounted or low introductory rates. The statement is focused on these
   types of ARMs and uses the interagency <i>Expanded Guidance for Subprime Lending</i> 
   (Expanded Guidance)<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a> issued
   in 2001 to determine subprime borrower characteristics. While the Statement is focused on subprime
   borrowers, the principles in the statement are also relevant to ARM products offered to non-subprime
   borrowers.</p>
<div class="pagebreak"><div class="hidden">pagebreak</div></div>
<div class="SectionHeader">Risk Management Practices</div>
<p>The risk management practices discussed in the <i>Subprime Statement</i> are generally consistent
   with existing interagency guidance regarding real estate lending, subprime lending, and nontraditional
   mortgage products.<a href="#Footnote2" name="Footref2" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a> Like the
    nontraditional mortgage guidance issued in 2006, this <i>Subprime Statement</i> encourages
   institutions to evaluate the borrower’s repayment capacity and ability to repay the loan by final
   maturity at the fully indexed rate, assuming a fully amortizing repayment 
   schedule.<a href="#Footnote3" name="Footref3" title="Footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a> Further,
   the <i>Subprime Statement</i> emphasizes that an institution’s assessment of a borrower’s repayment capacity should
   include an evaluation of the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio and states that this assessment should
   include total monthly housing-related payments (i.e., principal, interest, taxes, and insurance).</p>
<p>The <i>Subprime Statement</i> also emphasizes the risks of stated income or reduced documentation loans in
   the subprime sector and indicates institutions should document any factors relied upon to mitigate
   the risk inherent in extending such loans. Such factors could include a borrower’s favorable payment
   performance or substantial liquid reserves. A higher interest rate is not considered an acceptable
   mitigating factor. The statement emphasizes the importance of an institution verifying and documenting
   a borrower’s income in order to adequately analyze repayment capacity, particularly for subprime borrowers.
   Typically, an institution should be able to readily document income using a borrower’s recent W-2
   statements, pay stubs, or tax returns. In addition, institutions should develop strong control systems
   to monitor whether actual practices are consistent with internal policies and procedures, and to ensure
   appropriate corrective action in the event the institution fails to comply with applicable laws, regulations,
   internal policies, and third-party agreements.</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Workout Arrangements</div>
<p>The <i>Subprime Statement</i> reiterates the principles in the interagency <i>Statement on Working
   with Borrowers</i> (April&nbsp;2007) in which the agencies encouraged institutions to work constructively
   with residential borrowers who are in default or whose default is reasonably foreseeable. Both
   documents indicate that prudent workout arrangements that are consistent with safe and sound lending
   practices are generally in the long-term best interest of both the financial institution and the
   borrower. The Federal Reserve will not criticize institutions that pursue reasonable workout arrangements
with borrowers.</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Predatory Lending Considerations</div>
<p>The <i>Subprime Statement</i> outlines certain aspects of the covered lending practices that are considered
   predatory in nature and provides that institutions should not engage in these practices regardless
   of loan features. Further, the <i>Subprime Statement</i> clarifies that subprime lending is not synonymous
   with predatory lending and, therefore, there is no presumption that the ARM products discussed in
the <i>Subprime Statement</i> are predatory in nature.</p>
<div class="pagebreak"><div class="hidden">pagebreak</div></div>
<div class="SectionHeader">Consumer Disclosure Practices</div>
<p>The <i>Subprime Statement</i> states that institutions should ensure that communications with consumers,
   including advertisements, oral statements, and promotional materials provide clear and balanced information
   about the relative benefits and risks of the products offered. These communications should provide
   information about the costs, terms, features, and risks of the loan to the borrower, and should be
   provided in a timely manner, to assist consumers during the product selection process. Communications
   should include information on payment shock, prepayment penalties, balloon payments, cost of reduced
   documentation loans, and responsibility for taxes and insurance. With respect to prepayment penalties,
   borrowers should be provided a reasonable period of time (typically, at least 60&nbsp;days prior to
  the reset date) to refinance without penalty.<a href="#Footnote43" name="Footref4" title="Footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a> </p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Supervisory Review</div>
<p>Federal Reserve examiners are expected to carefully review for the risk management and consumer compliance
   concerns contained in this guidance as a part of ongoing examination activities. Examiners will take
   action against institutions that exhibit predatory lending practices, violate consumer protection
   or fair lending laws, engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or otherwise engage in unsafe
   or unsound lending practices.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this letter and the interagency statement to banking
   organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve, as well as to their own supervisory and examination
   staff. For questions concerning the safety and soundness sections of this guidance, please contact
   in the Board’s Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation: Sabeth&nbsp;Siddique, Assistant Director,
   at (202)&nbsp;452-3861; Virginia&nbsp;Gibbs, Senior Supervisory Financial Analyst, at (202)&nbsp;452-2521;
   or Brian&nbsp;Valenti, Supervisory Financial Analyst, at (202)&nbsp;452-3575.  For questions related
   to consumer disclosure practices or predatory lending considerations, please contact Kathleen&nbsp;Ryan,
   Counsel, or Jamie&nbsp;Goodson, Attorney, at (202)&nbsp;452-3667 in the Board’s Division of Consumer
   and Community Affairs.</p>

    <li><a name="Footnote1"></a>As discussed in the 2001 interagency <i>Expanded Guidance
      for Subprime Lending Programs</i>, the term “subprime” refers to the characteristics of individual
      borrowers. Subprime borrowers typically have weakened credit histories that include payment delinquencies
      and possibly more severe problems such as charge-offs, judgments, and bankruptcies. They also may
      display reduced repayment capacity as measured by credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, or other
      criteria that may encompass borrowers with incomplete credit histories.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref1">Return&nbsp;to&nbsp;text</a></li>
    <li><a name="Footnote2"></a>The 1993 <i>Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate
      Lending</i>, the 1999<i> Interagency Guidance on Subprime Lending</i>, the 2001 <i>Expanded
      Guidance for Subprime Lending Programs</i>, and the 2006 <i>Interagency Guidance
      on Nontraditional Mortgage Product Risks</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref2">Return&nbsp;to&nbsp;text</a></li>
    <li><a name="Footnote3"></a>The nontraditional mortgage (NTM) guidance covers mortgage products that
       allow borrowers to defer payment of principal and sometimes interest, including interest-only
       mortgages where a borrower pays no loan principal for the first few years of the loan and payment
       option ARMs where a borrower has flexible payment options with the potential for negative amortization.
       Because certain ARM products offered to subprime borrowers are fully amortizing, the NTM guidance
      does not cover such products.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref3">Return&nbsp;to&nbsp;text</a></li>
    <li><a name="Footnote4"></a>There is no supervisory expectation for institutions to waive contractual
      terms with regard to prepayment penalties on existing loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref4">Return&nbsp;to&nbsp;text</a></li>
