<p><b>Introduction and Summary</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Earlier this year, the Division of Banking Supervision and 
   Regulation (Division) outlined procedures for using System experts 
   and specialists outside of the banking supervision function 
   (internal experts) on supervision assignments.&nbsp; This letter 
   outlines the procedures and uniform documents that are to be used 
   when a Reserve Bank wants to engage an external expert 
   (or&nbsp;external consultant) to supplement existing examination 
   resources or to provide specialized expertise on an examination, 
   inspection, or other bank supervision matter where the external 
   expert will have access to confidential supervisory data, 
   databases, or financial institution data.&nbsp; The use of an 
   external expert to meet resource needs is permissible provided the 
   appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure that the Reserve Bank 
   and supervised financial institutions sufficiently are protected 
   from any misuse of information or conflict of interest, and further 
   provided that there are established practices to ensure that an 
   external expert will comply with applicable laws and 
   policies.&nbsp; The new program provides an additional tool for a 
   Reserve Bank that seeks to supplement its existing supervisory 
   resources.&nbsp; Other options include hiring temporary employees 
   and using System resource-sharing arrangements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The framework outlined in this letter addresses the supervisory 
   requirements and policies for Reserve Banks to use in their 
   procurement process to contract with an individual such as a 
   retired examiner, ex-banker, or academic to provide consulting 
   services on bank supervision matters.&nbsp; The framework is 
   <i>not</i> meant to allow arrangements with large or small 
   accounting, consulting, or audit <i>firms</i> for examination and 
   other bank supervision matters, which present more difficult policy, 
   legal, and clearance issues.&nbsp; If it appears that there is a 
   need to use the services of such entities for examination and other 
   bank supervision matters, the Reserve Bank should immediately 
   contact Board staff to determine if such an arrangement is 
   appropriate.&nbsp; Looking forward, we plan to reassess the 
   framework for using external experts/consultants in&nbsp;2002 to 
   determine modifications in scope that may be warranted, and to 
   assess, in general, the System's experience with using internal and 
   external experts on bank supervision matters.&nbsp;</p> 

<p><b>Reasons for Using External Experts</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Reserve Banks have expressed an interest in using nonemployee 
   experts or consultants on bank supervision matters for a number of 
   reasons.&nbsp; A Reserve Bank may seek to engage retired examiners 
   to address fluctuating resource demands, for example, in the event 
   of a rapid but temporary need for examiners experienced in loan 
   underwriting and credit review.&nbsp; An external expert may be 
   used to provide supplemental training, for example, to expose 
   examiners to new analytical techniques, or to provide on-the-job 
   training to examiners who have not experienced an economic 
   downturn, problem loans, or problem banks.&nbsp; While it is 
   important to maintain adequate resources and expertise on an 
   ongoing basis, a Reserve Bank may decide in a particular situation 
   that using a consultant is a more cost effective or efficient 
   approach to meeting a specialized skill need.&nbsp; For example, a 
   consultant may be engaged for a one-time assignment that does not 
   justify a full-time expert on staff, particularly if a System 
   expert is not available.&nbsp; Similarly, an external expert with 
   industry-specific knowledge may be retained to evaluate a business 
   activity that is nontraditional to banking, such as brokerage 
   services or insurance.</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   There are several caveats that a Reserve Bank should keep in mind 
   when it considers using an external consultant.&nbsp; The practice 
   should not reduce the overall strength of  System resources or 
   eliminate career advancement opportunities for Federal Reserve 
   examiners.&nbsp; Further, the practice should not compromise System 
   resource-sharing initiatives or use of competency/knowledge 
   centers.&nbsp; It is also imperative that a Reserve Bank 
   sufficiently review background and financial disclosures to 
   determine whether an individual is an appropriate candidate to work 
   for the Federal Reserve on bank supervision matters.</p>
 
<p><b>Compliance with System Contracting Guidelines and Required Documentation</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   It is not within the scope of this letter to describe all necessary 
   contract provisions and procurement procedures that a Reserve Bank 
   should use when  retaining the services of an external expert to 
   work on a bank supervision matter.&nbsp; In general, each Reserve 
   Bank seeking to retain such a consultant should follow its own 
   internal procurement procedures and must comply with System and 
   Reserve Bank acquisition guidelines, which promote competitive 
   acquisition processes through the use of requests for proposals 
   (RFPs) and other procurement tools.&nbsp; The acquisition 
   guidelines provide the flexibility to conduct a sole source award 
   for circumstances in which only one vendor has the capability to 
   provide the required services or the timeframes for the project 
   require immediate action.&nbsp; A contract should contain a 
   sufficiently detailed statement of work that is agreed to between 
   the Reserve Bank and the consultant.</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   This letter implements the use of uniform documents that must be 
   integrated into the Reserve Bank's procurement procedures.&nbsp; 
   The documents include: 
   (1)&nbsp;Federal Reserve Bank Consultant Agreement on 
      Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information Obtained from the 
      Banking Supervision Function 
      (Confidentiality 
       Agreement), 
   (2)&nbsp;Agreement for External Consultants in the Bank Supervision 
      Function
      (Consultant Agreement), 
   and 
   (3)&nbsp;two disclosure forms - the Reserve Bank Uniform Disclosure 
      Form For Supervision and Regulation Personnel 
      (Form&nbsp;D) and a 
      supplement to 
      Form&nbsp;D (Disclosure Forms).&nbsp; These documents 
   (Uniform Documents) are included as attachments to this letter, 
   Documents&nbsp;1&nbsp;-&nbsp;3, respectively.&nbsp; A 
   sample statement of work 
   is included in Document&nbsp;4.&nbsp; The Uniform Documents contain 
   provisions that are designed to provide the necessary safeguards to 
   protect the Reserve Bank's and the financial institution's 
   information, and to enable the Reserve Bank to sufficiently 
   evaluate potential legal and ethical issues, and to determine 
   conflicts of interest restrictions.&nbsp; While a Reserve Bank will 
   be expected to use the Uniform Documents when contracting with an 
   external expert for bank supervision services, a Reserve Bank may 
   opt to incorporate the provisions of the Consultant Agreement into 
   its standard procurement contract for obtaining consulting 
   services.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   In addition, uniform guidance (Guidance) has been developed for use 
   by a Reserve Bank to inform an external consultant working on a 
   bank supervision matter and an employee supervising that 
   consultant.&nbsp; The Guidance summarizes the rules that will apply 
   to the consultant while he or she is under contract to the Reserve 
   Bank (for example, the conflicts of interest requirements and 
   limitations to the consultant's authority).&nbsp; The Guidance is 
   contained in two documents: 
   (1)&nbsp;Use of External 
   Consultants within the Bank Supervision Function, and 
   (2)&nbsp;Expectations of 
   Consultants while Working on Bank Supervision Assignments, 
   which are included as Documents&nbsp;5&nbsp;and&nbsp;6.</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Individuals responsible for procurement at your Reserve Bank should 
   be advised of the unique requirements that will apply when the 
   Reserve Bank is contracting for examination and other bank 
   supervision services.&nbsp; For example, an external expert who is 
   to be credentialed as a temporary examiner must be either a 
   U.S.&nbsp;citizen or an immigrant alien lawfully admitted to the 
   United&nbsp;States with a permanent resident visa (valid Green 
   Card) and who has signed a Declaration of Intent to Become a United 
   States Citizen.&nbsp; Further, an external expert will be required 
   to make disclosures about his/her debt, investment, and employment 
   relationships so that a Reserve Bank can determine the propriety and 
   legality of a proposed assignment.&nbsp; Finally, a Reserve Bank is 
   expected to conduct an appropriate background, security, and/or 
   credit check in light of the work that is being proposed for the 
   consultant, using as a guide the requirements for Reserve Bank 
   employees performing similar 
   tasks.<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 
   1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p><b>Limitations on an External Expert's Authority</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   It is important to note that there are limitations on an external 
   expert's authority that reflect the distinctions between an 
   independent contractor/consultant and an employee.&nbsp; For 
   example, a consultant under contract with the Reserve Bank has the 
   authority to make recommendations, give opinions, and provide 
   analysis to the Reserve Bank only within the scope of the work 
   outlined in the consulting contract.&nbsp; A consultant does not 
   have policy, managerial, or decision-making authority, and may not 
   make final decisions.&nbsp; When participating with an examination 
   team on an examination or inspection, the consultant must report 
   to a designated employee such as the examiner-in-charge, and may 
   not serve as an examiner-in-charge.&nbsp; A consultant may not 
   attend a meeting with a supervised institution to present findings 
   or conclusions without a member of the examination team, the 
   examiner-in-charge, or other Reserve Bank representative being 
   present.&nbsp; The consultant may, however, independently perform 
   data-gathering functions, such as interviewing bank personnel or 
   attending meetings to collect information to complete his or her 
   work assignment.&nbsp; These and other provisions are outlined in 
   the Uniform Documents and Guidance to be provided to the 
   consultant.&nbsp;</p>  

<p><b>Ethics and Security Requirements for External Experts Working on 
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank Supervision Matters</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   As a matter of policy, the Division believes that external experts 
   to the bank supervision function should be subject to similar 
   conflicts of interest standards as Federal Reserve 
   employees.<a href="#Footnote2" name="Footref2" 
   title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp; For example, a consultant 
   may not participate in an examination of a bank where he or she, a 
   spouse, or a dependent child has a loan or 
   investment.<a href="#Footnote3" name="Footref3" 
   title="Footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a> A consultant may not, at any 
   time, use confidential information obtained while under contract 
   with the Reserve Bank for private gain or for the private gain of 
   another person or entity.&nbsp; While under contract, a consultant 
   may not invest in the debt or equity securities of any bank, 
   thrift, or other depository institution or any affiliate, but 
   unlike employees, may be permitted to make such an investment if it 
   does not involve or affect the consultant's present or proposed 
   assignment and only if specific authorization is granted by the 
   Reserve Bank's Ethics Officer.&nbsp; An external expert will not be 
   expected to divest of an existing investment in, or loan with a 
   bank, thrift, or other depository institution or any affiliate, 
   although such an investment or loan will have a bearing on the 
   supervisory assignments to which the consultant can be 
   assigned.&nbsp; A consultant should be provided the appropriate 
   training, information, and guidance to understand and comply with 
   this and other applicable conflicts of interest requirements and 
   any additional ethics requirements that may be imposed by the 
   Reserve Bank.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Any analysis or document prepared by an external expert for an 
   examination, inspection, or other supervision assignment is the 
   property of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
   (Board).&nbsp; A consultant granted access to confidential 
   information must comply with the Board's and Reserve Bank's 
   procedures for handling such information, and should receive 
   appropriate training, information, and guidance in this 
   regard.&nbsp; The consultant also may be subject to additional 
   prohibitions contained in the consulting contract with the Reserve 
   Bank.&nbsp;</p>  

<p><b>Required Notice to a Supervised Institution</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   When a Reserve Bank plans to use an external consultant on an 
   examination or inspection, or to complete on-site work at a 
   supervised institution, the Reserve Bank must advise the 
   institution in advance of the on-site work that a consultant will 
   be used and provide a letter of introduction for the consultant to 
   a senior executive of the institution (for example, the CEO or 
   president).&nbsp; A sample 
   letter of introduction for an examination is included as 
   Document 7.&nbsp; Each Reserve Bank, in its own discretion, may 
   determine who will call the appropriate senior executive at the 
   supervised institution and send the letter of 
   introduction.&nbsp;</p> 

<p><b>External Experts Participating in Examinations and Inspections</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   When an external expert will be  participating in an examination or 
   inspection of a supervised institution, a Reserve Bank must request 
   a temporary examiner credential following existing System 
   procedures.<a href="#Footnote4" name="Footref4" 
   title="Footnote 4"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp; In its request to the 
   Division, the Reserve Bank must include a completed temporary 
   credential disclosure form (i.e.,&nbsp;the same procedure currently 
   outlined for a noncredentialed employee obtaining a temporary 
   credential).&nbsp; In addition, the Reserve Bank also must include 
   an executed copy of the Consulting Agreement and the 
   Confidentiality Agreement.&nbsp; The 
   disclosure Form D and the 
   Supplement to 
   Form&nbsp;D that the consultant is required to complete as part 
   of the contracting process need not be included in the package 
   submitted to the Division.&nbsp; However, these disclosure 
   documents must be reviewed in advance by the Reserve Bank 
   (i.e.,&nbsp;during the contracting process) to determine and 
   resolve any conflict of interest issue that would have a bearing on 
   the proposed assignment and consulting contract.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   A request for a temporary examiner credential will be reviewed by 
   staff in the Division's System Planning, Budgeting, and Evaluations 
   Section.&nbsp; Staff will verify that the proposed assignment is 
   appropriate relative to the conflict of interest disclosures and 
   will ensure that the Division is in receipt of the required 
   documents (i.e.,&nbsp;letter request, temporary disclosure form(s), 
   Confidentiality Agreement, and Consultant Agreement).&nbsp; After 
   the appropriate Division review, the request will be forwarded to 
   the Board's Office of the Secretary for final approval.&nbsp; A 
   sample request and 
   credential are included as Document 8.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   An external expert who receives a temporary examiner credential is 
   subject to the same rules and laws governing participation in a 
   bank examination.&nbsp; The Consultant Agreement and the Guidance 
   outline these requirements.&nbsp; While holding a temporary 
   credential that is in effect and not expired, an external 
   consultant may not accept a loan, gift, or gratuity from a bank or 
   affiliated entity examined by the consultant 
   (18&nbsp;U.S.C.&nbsp;213).&nbsp; The consultant may not unlawfully 
   take or conceal any money, note, draft, bond, or any other property 
   of value from any bank or banking institution 
   (18&nbsp;U.S.C.&nbsp;655).&nbsp; The consultant may not disclose 
   information obtained on a bank examination, including the names of 
   borrowers or the collateral for loans, other than to appropriate 
   officers of the examined institution or the Reserve Bank 
   examination team or officials (18&nbsp;U.S.C.&nbsp;1906).&nbsp; A 
   violation of any of these statutes could result in criminal 
   prosecution.</p> 

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   This letter provides a framework for a Reserve Bank to pursue 
   contracting arrangements with external experts for bank supervision 
   services using the Reserve Bank's internal procurement
