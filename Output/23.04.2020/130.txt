<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Interagency Guidance on Authentication 
   in an Internet Banking Environment</div>
<p>The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council&nbsp;(FFIEC) has issued 
   the attached guidance titled <i>Authentication in an Internet Banking Environment</i>. 
   This guidance updates and replaces the FFIEC's <i>Authentication in an Electronic 
   Banking Environment</i> issued in 2001 and specifically addresses the need 
   for risk-based assessments, customer awareness, and security measures to reliably 
   authenticate customers accessing financial institutions' Internet-based services. 
   The guidance also emphasizes that the agencies consider single-factor authentication, 
   if it is the only control mechanism, to be inadequate for high-risk transactions 
   involving access to customer information or the movement of funds to other 
   parties.</p>
<p>This guidance applies to both retail and commercial customers and does not 
   endorse any particular technology. Financial institutions should use this 
   guidance when evaluating and implementing authentication systems and practices 
   whether they are provided internally or by a technology service provider. 
   Although this guidance is focused on the risks and risk management techniques 
   associated with the Internet delivery channel, the principles are applicable 
   to all forms of electronic banking activities. </p>
<p>Consistent with the FFIEC's <i>Information Security Booklet</i> (December&nbsp;2002), 
   which is incorporated in the <i>Information Technology Examination Handbook</i>, 
   financial institutions should periodically:<br>
</p>
<ul class="indent">
   <li>Ensure that their information security programs: 
      <ul>
         <li>Identify and assess the risks associated with the full range of 
            Internet-based products and services, </li>
         <li>Identify risk mitigation actions, including appropriate measures 
            to verify and authenticate customers, and </li>
         <li class="last">Measure and evaluate customer awareness efforts; </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Establish, evaluate, and adjust, as appropriate, their information 
      security programs in light of any relevant changes in technology, the sensitivity 
      of their customer information, and internal or external threats to information; 
      and</li>
   <li>Implement appropriate risk mitigation strategies.<br>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>Examiners should begin to assess financial institutions' progress in meeting 
   the expectations outlined in the guidance and thereafter monitor ongoing conformance 
   as needed during the risk-focused examination process. Financial institutions 
   will be expected to have achieved conformance with the guidance by year-end 
   2006. Examiners should document situations where financial institutions have 
   not achieved conformance with the guidance by that time. </p>
<p>Federal Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this letter and the interagency 
   guidance to banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve, as well 
   as to their supervisory and examination staff. If you have any questions concerning 
   this guidance, please contact Stacy&nbsp;Coleman, Assistant Director, Operational 
   and IT Risk Section, at (202)&nbsp;452-2934 or Elton&nbsp;Hill, Senior Supervisory 
   Financial Analyst, at (202)&nbsp;452-2514. </p>
