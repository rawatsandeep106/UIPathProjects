<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Interagency 
   Policy on Banks/Thrifts Providing Financial Support 
   to Funds Advised by the Banking Organization</div>
<p>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of 
   the Comptroller of the Currency, and Office of Thrift 
   Supervision (the agencies) have issued the attached 
   <i>Interagency Policy on Banks/Thrifts Providing 
   Financial Support to Funds Advised by the Banking 
   Organization or its Affiliates</i>. This interagency 
   policy statement sets forth the collective views 
   of the agencies concerning the safety and soundness 
   implications of a bank providing financial support 
   to investment funds advised by the bank or its affiliates 
   (i.e.,&nbsp;affiliated investment fund). </p>
<p>The three core principles 
   contained in the interagency policy statement emphasize 
   that a bank should <b>not</b>:</p>
<ul class="indent">
   <li>inappropriately place its resources and reputation 
      at risk for the benefit of affiliated investment 
      funds' investors and creditors;</li>
   <li>violate the limits and requirements contained 
      in sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve 
      Act and Regulation&nbsp;W, other applicable legal 
      requirements, or any special supervisory condition 
      imposed by the agencies; or </li>
   <li>create an expectation that the bank will prop 
      up the advised fund(s).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, bank affiliated investment advisers 
   are encouraged to establish alternate sources of 
   financial support to avoid seeking support from affiliated 
   banks. Finally, bank management is expected to notify 
   and consult with its appropriate federal banking 
   agency prior to (or immediately after, in the event 
   of an emergency) providing material financial support 
   to an affiliated investment fund.<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The guidance contained in the interagency policy 
   statement is consistent with the Board's existing 
   guidance issued in 1994 through <a href="/boarddocs/srletters/1994/SR9453.htm">SR 
   letters&nbsp;94-53</a>, <i>Investment Adviser Activities</i>, 
   and 94-54, <i>Contributions by Banking Organizations 
   to Mutual Funds and Common Investment Funds</i>. 
   With the issuance of this interagency policy statement, 
   SR&nbsp;letter 94-54 is rescinded. However, the sound 
   practices for management and oversight of investment 
   adviser activities recommended in SR&nbsp;letter&nbsp;94-53 
   remain valid. </p>
<p>As with certain other supervisory guidance issued 
   prior to passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act&nbsp;(GLBA), 
   examiners are reminded of the necessary modifications 
   in the implementation of that guidance in the context 
   of functional regulation. Under GLBA the SEC, as 
   the functional regulator of the investment advisory 
   activities of registered investment advisors, has 
   primary rulemaking and supervisory responsibility 
   for those advisers.&nbsp; Accordingly, the guidance 
   advanced in SR&nbsp;letter&nbsp;94-53 as it pertains 
   to the examination of investment advisers to mutual 
   funds should now be viewed principally as guidance 
   applicable to the parent bank or bank holding company 
   in its oversight and control of functionally regulated 
   entities.<a href="#Footnote2" name="Footref2" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
   All other advisory activities, such as trust departments 
   operating collective investment funds, remain subject 
   to the guidance contained in SR&nbsp;letter&nbsp;94-53 
   as well as the new interagency guidance on providing 
   financial support to funds advised by banking organizations. 
</p>
<p>Reserve Banks are requested to send a copy of this 
   SR&nbsp;letter and the interagency policy statement 
   to senior management at domestic and foreign banking 
   organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve. 
   If you have any questions or are notified of actual 
   or pending material financial support by a state 
   member bank, or branch or agency subject to Federal 
   Reserve supervision, please contact Jim&nbsp;Embersit, 
   Deputy Associate Director (202-452-5249), or Mike&nbsp;Schoenfeld, 
   Senior Supervisory Financial Analyst (202-452-2836), 
   Market and Liquidity Risk Section. </p>
