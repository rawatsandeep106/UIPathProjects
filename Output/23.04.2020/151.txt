<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement on Loss Mitigation Strategies for Servicers of Residential
Mortgages</div>
<p>The Federal Reserve along with the other federal financial agencies and Conference of State Bank Supervisors&nbsp;(CSBS)
   issued the attached statement to encourage regulated institutions and state supervised entities that
   service residential mortgages&nbsp;(servicers) to pursue strategies to mitigate losses while preserving
   homeownership to the extent possible and appropriate.<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a> The
   statement addresses the special issues of servicers of securitized mortgage loans that were not addressed
   in other recent interagency statements on residential mortgage lending.<a href="#Footnote2" name="Footref2" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The statement outlines the steps a servicer may pursue when there is an increased risk of default,
   including: identifying borrowers at heightened risk of delinquency or default, contacting borrowers
   to assess their ability to repay, and determining whether default is reasonably foreseeable. The statement
   goes on to explain possible loss mitigation techniques that a servicer may pursue with a borrower.
   The agencies and CSBS recognize that servicers have to consider the governing documents for the securitization
   trust to determine their authority to restructure loans that are delinquent or are in imminent risk
   of default. Servicers should also consider referring appropriate borrowers to qualified homeownership
counseling services that may be able to work with all parties to avoid unnecessary foreclosures.</p>
