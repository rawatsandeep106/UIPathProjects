   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Recent examination reviews of documentation governing securitization transactions 
   have uncovered covenants that use adverse supervisory actions or the breach of 
   supervisory thresholds as triggers for early amortization events or the transfer 
   of servicing.&nbsp; Examples of supervisory actions include a downgrade in the 
   organization's CAMELS rating, an enforcement action, or a downgrade in a bank's 
   prompt corrective action capital category.&nbsp; The inclusion in securitization 
   documents of supervisory-linked covenants will be considered by the federal 
   banking agencies as an &quot;unsafe and unsound banking practice&quot; that 
   undermines the objective of supervisory actions and thresholds.&nbsp;  An early 
   amortization or transfer of servicing triggered by such events can create or 
   exacerbate liquidity and earnings problems for a banking organization that may 
   lead to further deterioration in its financial condition.</p>  

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   On May&nbsp;23,&nbsp;2002, the federal banking agencies issued guidance alerting 
   banking organizations' management and boards of directors to the safety and 
   soundness implications of certain covenants included in securitization 
   documents.&nbsp; A copy of the guidance is attached.</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Convenants that contain triggers tied, directly or indirectly, to supervisory 
   actions or thresholds can result in the early amortization of a securitization 
   at a time when the sponsoring organization's ability to access other funding 
   sources is limited.&nbsp; The early amortization of a securitization's bonds 
   can cause investors to lose confidence in the stability of the sponsoring 
   organization's asset-backed securities, limiting its ability to raise new funds 
   through securitization.&nbsp; At the same time the organization must fund new 
   receivables on balance sheet, potentially resulting in liquidity problems.&nbsp; 
   Moreover, the existence of a supervisory-linked trigger potentially could 
   inhibit supervisors from taking action intended to address problems at a 
   troubled institution because they could trigger an event that worsens an 
   institution's condition or causes its failure.&nbsp;</p>  

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies are further concerned 
   that covenants related to supervisory actions may obligate a banking 
   organization's management to disclose confidential examination information, 
   such as the CAMELS rating.&nbsp; Disclosure of such information by a banking 
   organization's directors, officers, employees, attorneys, auditors, or 
   independent auditors, without explicit authorization by the institution's 
   primary regulator, violates the agencies' information disclosure rules and may 
   result in follow-up supervisory actions.</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>A banking organization's management should ensure that documents governing 
   securitizations it sponsors do not include any covenants related to supervisory 
   actions or thresholds</b>.&nbsp; Effective immediately, the use of covenants that 
   provide for the early amortization of a securitization or compel the transfer of 
   servicing as a result, directly or indirectly, of the occurrence of a supervisory 
   action or event will, under appropriate circumstances, be criticized as an 
   unsafe and unsound banking practice.&nbsp; Moreover, banking organization 
   management is encouraged to amend, modify, or remove these covenants from 
   existing transactions.&nbsp; Any impediments a banking organization may have to 
   taking such actions should be documented and discussed immediately with its 
   Reserve Bank.</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   This letter and the attached guidance should be distributed to state member 
   banks, bank holding companies, and foreign banking organizations supervised by 
   the Federal Reserve that securitize assets.&nbsp; If you have any questions 
   regarding this guidance, please contact Tom&nbsp;Boemio, Senior Supervisory 
   Financial Analyst, (202/&nbsp;452-2982), or Anna&nbsp;Lee&nbsp;Hewko, Senior 
   Financial Analyst, (202/&nbsp;530-6260).</p>
