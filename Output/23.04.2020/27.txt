        period specified in paragraph (1) with respect to the second 
        offer.''.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, whereas 
the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection issued a final rule entitled 
``Integrated Mortgage Disclosures Under the Real Estate Settlement 
Procedures Act (Regulation X) and the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation 
Z)'' (78 Fed. Reg. 79730 (December 31, 2013)) (in this subsection 
referred to as the ``TRID Rule'') to combine the disclosures a consumer 
receives in connection with applying for and closing on a mortgage loan, 
the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection should endeavor to provide 
clearer, authoritative guidance on--
            (1) the applicability of the TRID Rule to mortgage 
        assumption transactions;

[[Page 132 STAT. 1306]]

            (2) the applicability of the TRID Rule to construction-to-
        permanent home loans, and the conditions under which those loans 
        can be properly originated; and
            (3) the extent to which lenders can rely on model 
        disclosures published by the Bureau of Consumer Financial 
        Protection without liability if recent changes to regulations 
        are not reflected in the sample TRID Rule forms published by the 
        Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.

        Bank Leverage Ratio that falls below the percentage developed 
        under paragraph (1) after exceeding the percentage developed 
        under paragraph (1).

    (c) Capital Compliance.--
            (1) In general.--Any qualifying community bank that exceeds 
        the Community Bank Leverage Ratio developed under subsection 
        (b)(1) shall be considered to have met--

from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you 
should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who 
gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit 
report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any 
subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, 
mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit.
    `` `As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to 
place an initial or extended fraud alert on your credit file at no cost. 
An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's 
credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit 
file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's 
identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity 
theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud 
alert lasting 7 years.
    `` `A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its 
affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or 
entity, with which you have an existing account that requests 
information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or 
collecting the account. Reviewing the account includes activities 
related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and 
account upgrades and enhancements.'.
