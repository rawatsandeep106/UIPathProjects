&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Purpose and Scope</b>.&nbsp; The Board has delegated authority to the Reserve
Banks to approve protested applications and notices if the comments meet certain
criteria and if the proposal would otherwise be eligible for delegation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The final rule
adopting changes to Regulation Y<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></a> states that supervisory guidance would be
developed to identify the limited types of comments that may be considered under
delegated authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of developing this guidance, the final rule noted the
Board's intent that the vast majority of comments that have been considered by the
Board in the past would continue to be considered to be substantive and would, as
now, be reviewed by the Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, all matters raised by a protest must
clearly meet the delegation criteria described below to qualify for delegated action. 
Otherwise, such cases should continue to be processed for Board action.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the changes made to Regulation Y, the Board also determined
to adhere to its established rule of considering a comment involving an application or
notice only if the comment is provided to the System before the expiration of the
comment period.&nbsp;&nbsp;The final rule retains the current 30 day public notice requirement
for all bank acquisition proposals.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has also taken a number of steps to
improve public notice, including making up-to-date information available by mail, fax,
and the Internet regarding proposals with public comment periods.&nbsp;&nbsp;The public also
continues to have other means of providing input on the effectiveness of an insured
depository institution in meeting the convenience and needs of the community by
submitting comments in connection with the on-site examination of an institution's
performance under the Community Reinvestment Act (&quot;CRA&quot;).&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board retained the
discretion to consider untimely comments, but only in extraordinary circumstances.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter provides guidance on comments in general, and on applying
the delegation criteria and responding to the comments if the criteria are met.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is
important that comments be reviewed immediately on receipt and that a decision be
made promptly on whether the proposal requires processing under the normal 60 day
procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in more detail in the guidance, Reserve Banks are
encouraged to contact Board staff, and, in particular, the Legal Division, on all
proposals with comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Board staff from different Divisions will then consult with
each other, as appropriate.<br>
<p>
<ol type=I>
<b><li>Timely and Substantive Comments</b>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case with a timely and substantive comment, other than a comment
that supports approval of the proposal, does not qualify for processing under the
delegation criteria and must be processed as a Board case under the normal 60 day
procedures.<br>
<p>
<ul>
<i>Definition of substantive comment</i> -- A comment is substantive unless it clearly
qualifies under the delegation criteria that relate to individual customer
complaints, previously decided issues, minority shareholder rights issues,
frivolous or unsubstantiated claims, or issues that are not related to factors in
the Bank Holding Company Act (&quot;BHC Act&quot;), as discussed below. <br>
<p>
<i>Definition of timely comment</i> -- A comment is timely if, on or before the last day
in the comment period, it is (a) mailed first class, properly addressed, and
postmarked, (b)&nbsp;entered into an express delivery system for the proper
destination, or (c)&nbsp;received by the Board or the Reserve Bank. <br>
<p>
<i>Extension of comment period</i> -- The Board (but not the Reserve Banks) may
either grant or deny a written request by a commenter to extend the comment
period.&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the Board may grant an extension of up to 15 days to a
requester that has made a timely request for an application that has not been
made available to the public, and will grant a joint request of an interested
member of the public and the applicant for an extension for a reasonable period
of time for a purpose related to a factor in the BHC Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;An extension applies
only to the particular requester, unless the Board expressly extends the
comment period for all commenters.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reserve Bank should immediately
inform the Board's Legal Division and send all extension requests to the Legal
Division on receipt.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Legal Division will coordinate with other interested
Divisions regarding the request. <br>
<p>
In considering a request for an extension, the Board will consider the specific
reasons given by the requester for being unable to file a timely comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;For
example, if a requester contends that more time is required to analyze a
proposal, the Board will take into account a number of factors, including when
the proposal was announced, when the regulatory filing was made available to
the public, and when the request for the regulatory filing was made.&nbsp;&nbsp;Delays
beyond the time normally provided for answering a timely and reasonable
request for publicly available information, or in providing information in response
to timely comments, will also be considered in determining whether to grant an
extension of the comment period.&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants are expected to provide
responses to requests for information in accordance with the Board's Rules of
Procedure. <br>
<p>
An extension of the comment period would not disqualify an otherwise
qualifying proposal from consideration under the streamlined procedures or the
normal 30 day procedures for delegated cases. <br>
<p>
<i>Untimely comments</i> -- An untimely comment, including a supplemental
comment from a timely commenter, generally will be returned to the commenter
with a brief explanation of the public comment procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;If appropriate, a
copy of the comment should first be provided to the appropriate federal banking
agency (&quot;AFBA&quot;) for consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp;An untimely substantive comment may be
considered under extraordinary circumstances, and the Reserve Bank should
immediately consult with Board staff on receipt of such a comment. <br>
<p>
<i>Request for hearing or public meeting</i> -- A request for a hearing or public
meeting would not necessarily disqualify an otherwise qualifying proposal from
consideration under the streamlined procedures or the normal 30 day
procedures for delegated cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reserve Bank should immediately consult
with the Board's Legal Division on receipt of a hearing or public meeting
request to determine if a hearing or meeting should be held.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</ul>
<p>
<b><li>Protested Cases Eligible for Delegated Action</b>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has delegated authority to the Reserve Banks and the
Secretary of the Board, as appropriate, to act on applications and notices that
otherwise meet the delegation criteria and that involve certain types of comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;A
comment will not disqualify a case from action on delegated authority if the comment
supports approval of the proposal or the comment raises solely matters described
below.<br>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<b><li>Qualifying Criteria</b>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><i>Minority shareholder disputes that are unrelated to a statutory factor
required to be considered.</i>
<p>
<ul>
Applications and notices involving comments contesting the &quot;fairness&quot; of
the transaction to minority shareholders in terms of stock pricing,
exchange ratios, other matters that affect the value of the transaction to
minority shareholders, or dilution of minority shareholder influence, may
be processed under delegated authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a proposal with
comments by minority shareholders that relate to the competence of
management or that allege acts of improper conduct by management,
violations of applicable laws or regulations, or adverse financial effects
on the institution, would generally require Board action. <br>
</ul>
<p>
<li><i>Complaints based on an individual customer transaction, such as a
complaint relating to an individual loan denial or a loan foreclosure proceeding,
involving a financial institution that received a &quot;satisfactory&quot; or &quot;outstanding&quot;
rating at its most recent CRA performance examination and one of the two
highest ratings at its most recent compliance examination</i>.
<p>
<ul>Applications and notices involving customer complaints against an
institution that are based on an individual transaction between the
commenter and the institution may be processed under delegated
authority if the institution was rated satisfactory or better at its most
recent CRA performance examination and received one of the two
highest ratings at its most recent compliance examination.&nbsp;&nbsp;These types
of comments should be referred to the appropriate department of the
Reserve Bank for investigation if the institution is supervised by the
System, or to the AFBA.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the comment provides supporting facts, or
the System has information available, that indicate that the alleged
conduct could involve a pattern or practice of violating fair lending laws
or relate to the institution's CRA performance, the proposal would
generally require Board action. <br>
</ul>
<p>
<li><i>Specific issues that have been considered by the Board regarding the
relevant institutions within the preceding year</i>. <br>
<p>
<ul>
Applications or notices involving comments that are substantially identical
to, or that incorporate by reference, prior comments that have been
considered by the Board within the preceding year may be processed
under delegated authority if no new issue is raised by the commenter
and no new information or development is presented that is related to
the matters raised by the commenter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Developments that may require
review could include, for example, a performance examination
downgrade or a review of the institution's practices, particularly practices
related to fair lending law compliance, by the System or the AFBA that
indicates a weakening in the institution's performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;An application or
notice involving comments from a previous commenter that present new
facts regarding the applicant institution material to the statutory factors
and not previously considered by the Board would be processed for
Board action.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, new information could include revised or
updated data, a study supporting the allegations completed since the last
comment, or information about different geographic areas or banking
markets. <br>
<p>
In applying the criteria, special attention must be paid to the details of
the comment rather than the general category of the allegations raised. 
For example, a comment that raises specific concerns about the
managerial or CRA records of an applicant would not be considered
duplicative of a previous comment regarding the same applicant that was
also based on managerial or CRA grounds unless substantially the same
specific information and comments were made in the previous case.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
fact that both comments are broadly classified as related to managerial
resources or CRA factors would not be sufficient to permit delegated
action. <br>
<p>
Comments that would fall within this category but for the fact that they
were previously considered by the Board outside the one year period
may, however, be eligible for delegation under paragraph 5(iii) below.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
these situations, the Reserve Bank should consult with Board staff to
determine if delegated action is appropriate. <br>
</ul>
<p>
<li><i>Unadjudicated disputes that arise under a statute administered and enforced
by another agency in areas, such as employment discrimination, that the Board
has decided are beyond its jurisdiction under the relevant statutory factors.</i> <br>
<p>
<ul>
The Board has determined that its limited jurisdiction to review
applications and notices under the specific statutory factors in the BHC
Act does not authorize the Board to adjudicate disputes between a
commenter and an applicant that arise under a statute, other than a
banking statute, administered and enforced by a federal or state agency
(other than a federal or state banking agency) or the courts.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
particular, the Board has determined that disputes that arise in the areas
of employment discrimination, securities law, unfair trade practices
(similar name disputes), and state laws on corporate governance would
be within the category of comments that are beyond the Board's
jurisdiction to resolve and would meet this delegation criterion.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is
not an exhaustive list of areas that fall within this category, and the
Reserve Banks should consult with the Board's Legal Division if it
appears that comments address disputes in other areas that may be
beyond the Board's jurisdiction to consider.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reserve Bank should
forward copies of comments that fall under this category to the
appropriate federal or state agency. <br>
<p>
Comments that relate to an administrative or court finding of a violation
of a law or regulation or allegations involving banking laws and
regulations, however, would not fall within this category and therefore
would not be eligible for delegated action.&nbsp;&nbsp;Violations  of any statute or
regulation (including employment discrimination statutes and other laws
noted above) that have been determined by a court or by the agency
with appropriate jurisdiction may be relevant to an analysis of the
managerial resources of a bank holding company, and a proposal
protested on these grounds would be processed for Board action. <br>
</ul>
<p>
<li><i>With the concurrence of Board staff, an application or notice involving any
one of the following matters may be approved under delegated authority</i>: <br>
<p>
<ul>
(i)&nbsp; Alleged violations of law or applicable regulations without any
supporting evidence. <br>
<p>
The comment must not provide any facts supporting the matters raised,
as distinguished from a comment that is unpersuasive because it is not
supported by the weight of all the evidence. <br>
<p>
(ii)&nbsp; Allegations that do not relate to a statutory factor (CRA, financial,
managerial, competitive, supervisory or other statutory factors). <br>
<p>
This would include allegations relating to the motivation for an acquisition
that is otherwise consistent with applicable statutory considerations and
statements regarding potential public confusion about similarly named
organizations. <br>
<p>
(iii)&nbsp; Matters that do not otherwise warrant action by the Board. <br>
<p>
Consistent with the other delegation criteria, this &quot;catch-all&quot; criterion has
limited applicability, and Board staff anticipates that it would be used only
in extraordinary circumstances and on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;To obtain
Board staff's concurrence, please fax the protest and the analysis that
supports the Reserve Bank's conclusion that the matter is covered under
this criterion to Board staff (in particular, the Board's Legal Division), and
Board staff from the appropriate Divisions will determine if delegated
action is appropriate. <br>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Procedures</b>
<p>
<ul>
<i>Analysis</i> -- For cases that are determined to be eligible for delegated action, the
Reserve Bank is expected carefully to consider and analyze the comment and
include in the Reserve Bank staff memorandum a brief analysis as to the
reasons the record of the applicant, analyzed in light of the protest, meets the
statutory factors for approval, and demonstrating that the issues raised by the
protest fall within one of the categories for delegation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reserve Bank may
seek additional information necessary to evaluate any comment eligible for
delegated action. <br>
<p>
<i>Response to commenter</i> -- At the time action is taken on the proposal, the
Reserve Bank should provide the commenter with a letter explaining the basis
for concluding how, after considering the matters raised by the comments, the
proposal meets the statutory factors required to be considered by the Reserve
Bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;Responses to commenters must include a statement that the commenter
may request the Board to review the action taken by the Reserve Bank by
submitting the request to the Secretary of the Board not later than the fifth
business date after the date of the Reserve Bank's action.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reserve Banks
are encouraged to consult with the Board's Legal Division on the preparation of
the response and to provide a draft response for review when the Reserve
Bank is applying a criterion for the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reserve Bank should also
refer a comment for investigation to the AFBA or other relevant agency, if
appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Reserve Bank should notify the commenter by
telephone on the day an approval letter is signed of the action taken by the
Reserve Bank and of the commenter's right to request the Board to review the
action. <br>
