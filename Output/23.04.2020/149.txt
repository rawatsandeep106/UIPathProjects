<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fair Value Option and the Applicability of the Market Risk
Capital Rule</div>
<p>This SR Letter reminds banking organizations that reporting an amount of gross trading assets and
   liabilities that equals 10&nbsp;percent or more of total assets, or $1&nbsp;billion or more, may subject
   a banking organization to the market risk capital rule (<i>See 12&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;208, appendix E, for
   state member banks and 12&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;225, appendix&nbsp;E, for bank holding 
   companies</i>).<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a> The
   market risk capital rule requires banking organizations subject to the rule to have in place adequate
   risk management processes (including but not limited to Value-at-Risk model(s) approved by the Federal
Reserve) and capital sufficient to support the market risk of their covered positions. </p>
<p>A banking organization that has adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.&nbsp;159, <i>The
   Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities</i> 
   (FAS&nbsp;159)<a href="#Footnote2" name="Footref2" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a> and
   applied this option to securities should determine whether any resulting designation of securities
   as trading subjects the organization to the market risk capital rule. Banking organizations that
   have exceeded or expect to exceed in the near future the minimum thresholds for the market risk
   capital rule should contact their Reserve Bank to discuss their plans to address the ruleâ€™s requirements.
   As is the case for all market risk rule determinations, Reserve Bank staff will coordinate with
the Board to determine appropriate direction.</p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this SR&nbsp;Letter to the domestic and foreign banking organizations
   supervised by the Federal Reserve in their districts as well as to supervisory and examination staff.
   Questions regarding this SR&nbsp;Letter may be directed to Christopher&nbsp;Laursen, Senior Supervisory
   Financial Analyst, Market & Liquidity Risks, at (202)&nbsp;452-2478, in the Division of Banking Supervision
   and Regulation.</p>
