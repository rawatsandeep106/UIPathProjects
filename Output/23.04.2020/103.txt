   The Federal Reserve, along with the Office of the Comptroller of 
   the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, have 
   issued enhanced guidance concerning the elements of an effective 
   country risk management process for banking organizations.&nbsp; 
   Country risk is the risk that economic, social, or political 
   conditions in a foreign country might adversely affect an 
   organization's financial condition, primarily through impaired 
   credit quality or transfer risk.<a href="#Footnote1" 
   name="Footref1"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The interagency guidance, which is attached to this letter, builds 
   in part on the findings of a 1998&nbsp;study by the ICERC on the 
   country risk management practices of U.S.&nbsp;banks 
   (<a href="../1998/SR9833.htm" 
   target="_top">SR&nbsp;letter&nbsp;98-33</a>).&nbsp; 
   This new guidance supplements and strengthens existing guidance 
   with regard to country risk and is part of an ongoing effort by 
   the agencies, through their participation in the ICERC, to ensure 
   that banking organizations' management of risks arising from their 
   international activities are appropriately and adequately 
   addressed during the examination process.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Country risk can occur in many different forms, and the nature of 
   specific risks can change over time.&nbsp; It is essential that a 
   U.S.&nbsp;banking organization with significant direct or indirect 
   international exposure have in place an effective country risk 
   management process that is commensurate with the volume and 
   complexity of its international activities.&nbsp; Examiners should 
   continue to evaluate the adequacy of the country risk management 
   process at internationally active institutions, and should augment 
   their assessments using this new guidance.&nbsp; The interagency 
   guidance makes clear that this process should include, at a 
   minimum: effective oversight by the board of directors; adequate 
   risk management policies and procedures; an accurate country 
   exposure reporting system; an effective country risk analysis 
   process; a country risk rating system; country exposure limits; 
   ongoing monitoring of country conditions; periodic stress testing 
   of foreign exposures; and adequate internal controls and audit 
   function.&nbsp; An institution's country risk management process 
   should give particular attention to any concentrations of country 
   risk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Country risk is not necessarily limited to institutions with 
   direct international exposures.&nbsp; Domestic counterparties with 
   significant economic dependence on a foreign country or region 
   (for example, through export dependence) can pose indirect country 
   risk to institutions that do not have direct international 
   activity.&nbsp; While institutions are not required to incorporate 
   indirect country risk into a formal country risk management 
   process, they should nevertheless take these country risk factors 
   into account, where appropriate, when assessing the 
   creditworthiness of domestic counterparties.&nbsp; Examiners should 
   ensure that the overall credit risk management process takes into 
   account indirect country risk where applicable in all supervised 
   institutions.</p>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Reserve Banks are asked to forward this SR&nbsp;letter and the 
   attached interagency guidance to all state member banks and bank 
   holding companies supervised by the Federal Reserve in their 
   districts.&nbsp; If you have any questions, please contact 
   Michael&nbsp;Martinson, Associate Director, at 
   (202)&nbsp;452-3640, or T.&nbsp;Kirk&nbsp;Odegard, Supervisory 
   Financial Analyst, at (202)&nbsp;530-6225.</p>

    Transfer risk, which is evaluated by the Interagency Country 
    Exposure Review Committee&nbsp;(ICERC), is the possibility that 
    an asset cannot be serviced in the country of payment because 
    the obligorâ€™s country lacks the necessary foreign exchange or 
    has put restraints on its availability.  For more information, 
    see the Guide to the Interagency Country Exposure Review 
    Committee Process (<a href="../1999/SR9935.htm"
