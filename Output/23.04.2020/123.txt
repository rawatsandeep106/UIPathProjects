<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Interagency 
   Statement on the Purchase and Risk Management of 
   Life Insurance</div>
<p>The staffs of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
   Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 
   Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Office 
   of Thrift Supervision (the agencies) have issued 
   the attached Interagency Statement on the Purchase 
   and Risk Management of Life Insurance. This guidance 
   discusses the safety and soundness and risk management 
   implications of purchases and holdings of life insurance 
   by banks and savings associations (institutions).</p>
<p>Institutions may purchase 
   life insurance on their employees or others for several 
   appropriate business purposes. The most common purposes 
   for which institutions purchase bank-owned life insurance 
   (BOLI) are to recover the cost of providing pre- 
   and post-retirement employee benefits, to recover 
   losses associated with the death of a key person, 
   and to obtain insurance on borrowers.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, purchases of BOLI by 
   institutions have increased steadily and significantly. 
   This has given rise to concerns among the agencies 
   that some institutions may not have an adequate understanding 
   of the full array of risks posed by BOLI, including 
   liquidity, operational, reputational and compliance/legal 
   risks. The agencies also are concerned that some 
   institutions may have committed a significant amount 
   of capital to BOLI holdings without properly assessing 
   the associated risks. Over the same period, agency 
   staffs have noticed a significant rise in the number 
   of inquiries pertaining to BOLI posed by supervised 
   institutions and bank examination staff.</p>
<p>Such developments have highlighted the need for the 
   agencies to enhance and harmonize their supervisory 
   guidance on BOLI. The attached guidance is for institutions 
   and examination staff to help ensure that risk management 
   practices for BOLI are consistent with safe and sound 
   banking practices.</p>
<p>The guidance addresses the need for both a comprehensive 
   pre- and post-purchase analysis of BOLI risks and 
   rewards, as well as its unique characteristics. The 
   agencies expect institutions to have comprehensive 
   risk management processes applicable to their BOLI 
   purchases and holdings, including:</p>
<ul class="indent">
   <li>Effective senior management and board oversight;</li>
   <li>Comprehensive policies and procedures, including 
      appropriate limits regarding purchases; and</li>
   <li>An effective ongoing system of risk assessment, 
      management, monitoring and internal control processes, 
      including appropriate internal audit and compliance 
      frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The guidance highlights the agencies’ expectation 
   that when an institution plans to acquire BOLI resulting 
   in an aggregate cash surrender value in excess of 
   25&nbsp;percent of the applicable concentration threshold, 
   it should obtain prior approval from its board of 
   directors or the appropriate board committee. The 
   Federal Reserve’s concentration guidelines applicable 
   to state member banks define the capital base used 
   to determine the concentration threshold as a percentage 
   of Tier&nbsp;1 capital plus the allowance for loan 
   and lease losses.</p>
<p>The guidance also states that a “look-through” treatment 
   may be applied to BOLI holdings in separate account 
   assets for the purposes of assigning a regulatory 
   capital risk weight, subject to a 20&nbsp;percent 
   risk weight floor. An institution using the look-through 
   treatment should document its assessment, based upon 
   applicable state insurance laws and other relevant 
   factors, that the separate account assets would be 
   protected from the insurance carrier’s general creditors.</p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this SR letter 
   and the attached interagency guidance to state member 
   banks as well as to supervisory and examination staff. 
   Questions pertaining to this letter should be directed 
   to Barbara&nbsp;Cornyn, Senior Project Manager, Special 
   Activities Section, at (202)&nbsp;452-2434; Nancy&nbsp;Oakes, 
   Counsel, Enforcement Section, at (202)&nbsp;452-2743;
