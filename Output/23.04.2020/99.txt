   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Over the last several months, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller 
   of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of Thrift 
   Supervision have become aware of a number of instances in which a banking 
   organization provided credit support beyond its contractual obligation to one 
   or more of its securitizations.&nbsp; This type of support is commonly 
   referred to as &quot;implicit recourse&quot; (and sometimes as &quot;moral 
   recourse&quot;).&nbsp; Implicit recourse is of supervisory concern because 
   it demonstrates that the securitizing institution is re-assuming risk 
   associated with the securitized assets that the institution initially 
   transferred to the marketplace.</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Supervisors should be alert for instances where a banking organization provides 
   implicit recourse to a securitization.&nbsp; Providing implicit recourse can 
   pose a high degree of risk to a banking organization's financial condition and 
   to the integrity of its regulatory and public financial reports.&nbsp; 
   Heightened attention must be paid to situations in which an institution is more 
   likely to provide implicit recourse, for example, when securitizations are 
   nearing performance triggers that would result in an early amortization 
   event.<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp; Supervisors 
   should review securitization documents (for example, pooling and servicing 
   agreements) to ensure that the selling institution limits any support to the 
   securitization to the terms and conditions specified in the securitization 
   documents.&nbsp; Supervisors also should review a sample of loans or 
   receivables transferred between the seller and the trust to ensure that these 
   transfers were conducted in accordance with the contractual terms of the 
   securitization, particularly in cases where the overall credit quality of the 
   securitized loans or receivables has deteriorated.</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The banking agencies prepared the attached &quot;Interagency Guidance on 
   Implicit Recourse in Asset Securitization Activities&quot; to assist bankers 
   and supervisors in assessing the types of actions that may, or may not, 
   constitute implicit recourse.&nbsp; The guidance also outlines possible 
   supervisory actions a banking organization's primary regulator may take upon 
   determining that the banking organization has provided implicit recourse.&nbsp; 
   The actions may result in increased regulatory capital requirements for the 
   selling institution, including requiring regulatory capital to be held against 
   the entire amount of assets sold, as well as the possible deduction of residual 
   interests from regulatory capital.&nbsp;</p>  

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The Federal Reserve has long been concerned with the safety and soundness 
   implications of banking organizations extending implicit recourse to their 
   securitizations.&nbsp; The possible remedies outlined in the attached guidance 
   are consistent with well-established Federal Reserve policy.&nbsp; This letter 
   and the attached guidance should be distributed to state member banks, bank 
   holding companies, and foreign banking organizations supervised by the Federal 
   Reserve that engage in securitization activities.&nbsp; Questions pertaining 
   to this letter, or on asset securitization issues in general, should be 
   directed to Tom&nbsp;Boemio, Senior Supervisory Financial Analyst, 
   (202)&nbsp;452-2982 or Anna&nbsp;Lee&nbsp;Hewko, Senior Financial Analyst, 
   (202)&nbsp;530-6260.</p>

   For example, if excess spread in a revolving securitization is zero for three consecutive months, than the transaction begins to amortize earlier than scheduled in order to repay the asset-backed securities’ principal before the portfolio’s credit deterioration results in losses to investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
