<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Guidance on Filing Notices of Proposed Class Action Settlements</div>
<p>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is issuing this SR/CA letter to provide guidance
   to banking organizations under its supervision of requirements for filing notice of proposed settlements
   of class action litigation.</p>
<p>The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, Pub.L.&nbsp;No.&nbsp;109-2, 119&nbsp;Stat.&nbsp;4&nbsp;(2005)
   (codified at 28&nbsp;U.S.C.&nbsp;&sect;&nbsp;1715), requires financial institutions that are defendants
   in class action litigation to file with their primary Federal banking regulator (and, in the case
   of state-chartered institutions in the United&nbsp;States, with their state banking supervisor) a
   notice of any proposed settlement of such litigation if any of the matters alleged in the action are
   subject to regulation or supervision by such agencies. The notice requirements apply to federal and
   state depository institutions, depository institution holding companies, foreign banks, and non-depository
   institution subsidiaries of any of the foregoing entities. Within 10&nbsp;days after the filing of
   a proposed class action settlement agreement with the court, any defendant financial institution covered
   by the law and supervised by the Federal Reserve should send notice of the proposed settlement
   to the General Counsel at the responsible Federal Reserve Bank. Such notice should include the materials
	described in 28&nbsp;U.S.C.&nbsp;&sect;&nbsp;1715(b).</p>
<p>The notice required to be filed with the Federal Reserve Bank must also be filed with the financial
   institution&rsquo;s state bank supervisor, if any.</p>
<p>The notice requirements described above apply only when at least one matter at issue in the litigation
   is subject to regulation or supervision by the regulator. For example, settlement of a class
   action involving lending practices would give rise to the notice requirements described above, while
   a lawsuit involving only personnel issues would not.</p>
<p>A proposed settlement of class action litigation subject to these notice requirements may not be finally
   approved by the court until 90 days after service of the requisite notice on the appropriate Federal
   financial institutions regulator (and, where applicable, upon the appropriate state bank supervisor).</p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this SR/CA letter to the domestic and foreign banking organizations
   supervised by the Federal Reserve in their districts as well as to supervisory and examination staff.
   Questions regarding these notice requirements may be directed to Lisa&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Villarreal, Counsel,
   Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, at (202)&nbsp;721-4570, Steve&nbsp;Meyer, Assistant
   General Counsel, Legal Division, at (202)&nbsp;452-2522, or Paul&nbsp;Robin, Manager, Division of
   Consumer and Community Affairs, at (202)&nbsp;452-3140.</p>
