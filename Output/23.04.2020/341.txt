&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Board and Reserve Bank officials have been working with several state banking departments, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (the &quot;CSBS&quot;) and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &quot;FDIC&quot;) to address a variety of issues raised by
interstate branching.&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts include looking at how the appropriate federal regulator
and home state supervisor can effectively and efficiently coordinate the supervision and
examination of state-chartered banks operating across state lines. The concept of
&quot;seamless,&quot; or coordinated, supervision is of particular importance in this undertaking in
light of the multiple regulators that could supervise a state-chartered bank in an interstate
environment.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of these efforts,  the Board in April 1996,  approved the
State/Federal Protocol (the &quot;Protocol&quot;) and Model Agreement, which address the
supervision of state-chartered banks operating across state lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Protocol (attached)
is a statement of principles by the Board, the FDIC and the CSBS, on behalf of the state
banking departments.&nbsp;&nbsp;It provides that the appropriate federal regulator and home state
supervisor will endeavor to coordinate the supervision of interstate banks, particularly
those with assets of $1 billion or more, so as to reduce regulatory burden and minimize
duplicative regulatory actions, while fostering the safe and sound operation of the banks.
The Model Agreement specifies the actions that the appropriate federal regulator and the
home state supervisor would take to fulfill the goals of the Protocol, i.e., the seamless
supervision and examination of interstate, state-chartered banks. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since April&nbsp;1996, several Federal Reserve Banks have executed regional
agreements, based on the Model Agreement, with the state supervisors in their districts.
Also since April, Board and Reserve Bank officials have continued discussions with the
FDIC, various state banking departments, and the CSBS regarding how to strengthen
further the coordination of the supervision of state-chartered banks that branch interstate.
As a result of these discussions, and in an effort to continue to enhance the effectiveness,
efficiency and consistency of the supervision of state-chartered banks that branch
interstate, the Board along with the FDIC and state banking departments, has executed a
single Nationwide State/Federal Supervisory Agreement, a copy of which is attached.<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></a>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nationwide Agreement was signed on November 14, 1996 and contains
the same substantive provisions as were contained in the April 1996 Model Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;It
has been modified to reflect that the Board, rather than individual Reserve Banks, is a
signatory to the agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reserve Banks continue, however, to be responsible
under the Nationwide Agreement for implementing the provisions of the Agreement such
as the development of examination plans and the coordination of the processing of
applications and enforcement actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that, as with the Protocol, the Nationwide Agreement
outlines a &quot;best effort&quot; supervisory approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;The presumption is, of course, that we will
take a coordinated approach to the supervision of every interstate, state-chartered bank;
however, the agreement does not limit the ability of the Board, or the home state
supervisor for that matter, from taking any action, independent of the other, in the
fulfillment of its own supervisory or statutory responsibilities. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain actions required by the Nationwide Agreement, such as the
identification of state-chartered banks covered by the Protocol and Agreement  and the
designation of a primary contact person for each identified bank are to be completed within
the next month(s).&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Reserve Bank should contact the appropriate FDIC regional
office(s) and state banking departments in its district as soon as possible to begin
implementing the Nationwide Agreement. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact either Ann Marie&nbsp;Kohlligian, Senior Counsel, (202)&nbsp;452-3528 or William Spaniel, Assistant to the
Director, (202)&nbsp;452-3469.<br>

<p>
<br>
Statement of Purpose and Applicability</font>
<p>
<blockquote>The overall purpose of this Protocol is to outline a basic framework for
supervising state-chartered banks with interstate branches.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Accordingly, the goals and guiding principles of this Protocol apply to
any multi-state, state chartered bank.<a href="#Footnote2" title="Footnote 2" name="Footref2"><SUP>2</SUP></a>  The extent to which the
specific elements will apply depends upon the size and complexity of
the subject bank; all elements would normally apply to interstate
banks with total assets over $1 billion.</blockquote>
<p>
<ol type=I>
<font size = +1>
<li>Goals and Guiding Principles</font><br>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<li>The goals of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &quot;Board&quot;), the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &quot;FDIC&quot;) and the State Banking Departments are
to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions; to supervise and examine in a
seamless, flexible and risk-focused manner; to minimize regulatory burden and expense; and
to foster consistency, coordination, and communication among the appropriate Federal and
State regulators.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<p>
<li>To achieve these goals, the Board, the FDIC and the State Banking Departments resolve to: <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>Coordinate the supervisory process to achieve a seamless and flexible regulatory
program for state-chartered banks with a multi-state presence. <br>
<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Recognize the Home State Supervisor<a href="#Footnote3" title="Footnote 3" name="Footref3"><SUP>3</SUP></a> as the single point of state contact
for a particular interstate bank consistent with the CSBS Protocol adopted
April 20, 1995.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Responsible Federal Reserve Bank and the Responsible
FDIC Regional Office, respectively, will coordinate primarily with the Home
State Supervisor for state member banks and state nonmember banks.<a href="#Footnote4" title="Footnote 4" name="Footref4"><SUP>4</SUP></a> <br>
</ol>
<p>
<li>Develop a supervisory program that is tailored to a bank's condition and risk profile
and that specifically recognizes and addresses its unique characteristics. <br>
<p>
<li>Coordinate fully the applications process by promoting consistency in approach and
developing common forms. <br>
<p>
<li>Provide information to a multi-state bank as to the laws and regulations governing
its operations and the general regulatory policies and standards applicable to its
supervision process. <br>
</ol></ol>
<p>
<font size = +1><li>Supervisory Process
<p>
<ol type=A>
<li>Supervisory Plan</font>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>The Home State Supervisor and Responsible Federal Agency
will each identify a specific individual responsible for developing
and coordinating the supervisory process for each state
chartered bank operating in more than one state.&nbsp;&nbsp;These
individuals will, among other things, serve as the liaison with
bank management and will ensure that the principles of this
Protocol are achieved. <br>
<p>
<li>The Home State Supervisor and Responsible Federal Agency
will jointly develop and update, as needed, a comprehensive
supervisory plan covering an agreed upon planning horizon for
each bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan will take into consideration the bank's
organizational structure and risk profile.<a href="#Footnote5" title="Footnote 5" name="Footref5"><SUP>5</SUP></a>  It will address the
scheduling and timing for safety and soundness and specialty
examinations<a href="#Footnote6" title="Footnote 6" name="Footref6"><SUP>6</SUP></a> and/or targeted reviews, off-site monitoring
programs, and meetings with bank management. <br>
<p>
<li>The Home State Supervisor and Responsible Federal Agency
will take all necessary steps to implement the supervisory plan
and will coordinate with Host States and Local Federal Reserve
Banks or Local FDIC Regional Offices. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<font size = +1><li>Examinations</font><br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>The over-riding goal of this Protocol is to minimize regulatory
burden and maximize efficiency by conducting joint or
alternating examinations.<a href="#Footnote7" title="Footnote 7" name="Footref7"><SUP>7</SUP></a> <br>
<p>
<li>The scope of on-site examinations will be jointly developed
during the pre-examination period for joint examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Home State Supervisor and Responsible Federal Agency will
consult, as appropriate, on the scope of alternate examinations.
The scoping process will focus on ensuring examinations are
risk-focused. <br>
<p>
<li>Based on this planning, the Home State Supervisor and
Responsible Federal Agency will prepare a single joint entry
letter for joint examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;With an emphasis on reducing
regulatory burden, entry letters for both joint and alternate
examinations will request information critical to the examination
process or off-site evaluation, thereby minimizing on-site
efforts. <br>
<p>
<li>The Home State Supervisor and Responsible Federal Agency
will coordinate off-site and on-site examination work and will
make every effort to avoid duplicative information requests.
Examiners will coordinate requests for critical information
related to centralized functions, such as risk management or
credit review, that cross legal entity lines. <br>
<p>
<li>For joint examinations, the Home State Supervisor and
Responsible Federal Agency will prepare a joint examination
report that clearly and concisely identifies supervisory issues
and any required corrective action.<a href="#Footnote8" title="Footnote 8" name="Footref8"><SUP>8</SUP></a> <br>
</ol>
<p>
<font size = +1><li>Supervisory Actions</font>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>The Home State Supervisor and Responsible Federal Agency
will, in all cases, consult one another regarding supervisory
actions.</li>
<p>
<li>When the Home State Supervisor and Responsible Federal
Agency jointly deem that a follow-up supervisory action is
warranted, both agencies will take any necessary steps to
develop and implement a joint action.</li>
</ol></ol>
<p>
<font size = +1><li>Communications</font>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<li>The individuals designated by the Home State Supervisor and Responsible Federal Agency as
responsible for a particular bank will take all necessary steps to facilitate clear
communication and information sharing in order to reduce burden on the institution and to
keep each other informed of developments pertinent to supervision of the bank.<a href="#Footnote9" title="Footnote 9" name="Footref9"><SUP>9</SUP></a></li>
<p>
<li>Nothing in this Protocol preempts any statutory or regulatory obligation of a bank to provide
specific information or file required reports with a  Federal or State supervisor.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<font size = +1><li>Applicable Law</font>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<li>The Board, the FDIC and the State Banking Departments recognize  they may not
necessarily be empowered to waive provisions of Home or Host State law directly applicable
to multi-state banks or their branches in Host States.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to assist multi-state, state-chartered institutions and their counsel in resolving issues of applicable law, the Board, the
FDIC and the State Banking Departments agree that these issues may be addressed using
the following general principles.
<p></li>
<ol type=1>
<li>Host State law shall apply generally to the operations of a branch of a multi-state
bank in the Host State including: (i)  antitrust law and deposit concentration limits;
(ii) community reinvestment and similar laws; (iii) consumer protection laws,
including lending and usuary laws to the extent that laws or court decisions
regarding the exportation of interest rates are inapplicable; (iv) fair lending or equal
credit laws; and (v) other operational matters where competitive equality with host
state banks may be an issue. <br>
<p>
<li>Home State law shall apply generally to the corporate structure and internal policies
and procedures of a multi-state bank including: (i) charter and bylaws; (ii)
incorporation and dissolution; (iii) board of directors and management; (iv) capital; (v)
loans, lending limits and investments; (vi) common trust funds; (vii) dividends; (viii)
indemnification of directors and officers; (i) stock and debt; and (x) structure of
bank subsidiaries. <br>
<p>
<li>These provisions are not intended to supersede any cooperative agreements between
the states.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</ol></ol>
<p>
<b><font size = +1><li>Applications</font></b>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<li>The Home State Supervisor and the Responsible Federal Agency will
closely coordinate on all applicable applications matters. <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>The Home State Supervisor and the Responsible Federal Agency
will take all appropriate actions to ensure that applications filed
by multi-state banks are processed in a coordinated and timely
fashion by their respective agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<p>
<li>Common applications forms and applications requirements, such
as concurrent processing periods, will be developed to the
extent practicable under State and Federal law. <br>
<p>
<li>To the extent that applications forms differ, the Home State
Supervisor and the Responsible Federal Agency will accept
needed information contained on the other agency's forms,
where practicable. <br>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement is made and entered into by and between the Parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is
not intended to prevent the Parties from entering into other agreements or
arrangements regarding the subject matter of the Agreement.<br>
<p>
<br>
<b><font size = +1>
<ol type=I>
<li>Statement Of Purpose</b></font>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<font size = +1><li>Goals</font>
<p>
The Parties recognize that state-chartered banks will establish
interstate branches creating a compelling need for enhanced
cooperation among Federal and State regulatory agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The goals
of the Parties to this Agreement are to:&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;provide for a seamless
supervisory process; (2) ensure that supervision is flexible and
commensurate with the organization's risk; and (3) minimize
regulatory burden and cost. <br>
<p>
<font size = +1><li>Responsibilities</font>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>The State Supervisory Authorities that are parties to this
Agreement (collectively the "State Supervisory Authorities")
have endorsed the Nationwide Cooperative Agreement, dated
November 13, 1996, which governs the supervisory
responsibilities among the State Supervisory Authorities for
Multi-State Banks in such states. <br>
<p>
<li>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
&quot;Board of Governors&quot;) and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the &quot;FDIC&quot;) recognize the responsibility of the
Home State Supervisor to coordinate the involvement of Host
State Supervisors in the supervision and examination of Multi-State Banks, as set forth in the CSBS Interstate Banking and
Branching Supervisory Protocol dated April 20, 1995.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
<li>The State Supervisory Authorities, the Board of Governors and
the FDIC have endorsed the State/Federal Supervisory Protocol,
(the &quot;State/Federal Protocol&quot;), which is attached as Exhibit&nbsp;1,
and which outlines the responsibilities of the Responsible
Federal Agency and Home State Supervisor for a Multi-State
Bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement between the Parties implements the
State/Federal Protocol and sets forth the procedures to fulfill its
goals and terms. <br>
</ol></ol>
<p>
<b><font size = +1><li>Supervision And Examination Process</font></b>
<p>
The Parties agree to adopt and implement the procedures for the supervision
and examination of Multi-State Banks as set forth in the State/Federal
Protocol and, at a minimum, to take the following steps: <br>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<li>Within 30 days of the date of this Agreement, the Responsible Federal
Agencies and the Home State Supervisors will identify the Multi-State
Banks covered by the supervisory program set forth in the
State/Federal Protocol and this Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarterly basis, this
list will be reviewed and, as needed, updated. <br>
<p>
<li>Within 60 days of the date of this Agreement, the Responsible Federal
Agency and the Home State Supervisor will each designate a Primary
Contact Person for each of the subject Multi-State Banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among
other things, these individuals will jointly coordinate the supervisory
and examination responsibilities of their respective agencies according
to the principles of the State/Federal Protocol and this Agreement.
The Responsible Federal Agency and the Home State Supervisor and
the Primary Contact Persons, in particular, will take the necessary
steps to ensure that the goals of the State/Federal Protocol and this
Agreement, including a risk-focused, seamless supervisory process,
are achieved. <br>
<p>
<li>The Primary Contact Persons will develop and, as needed, update a
written comprehensive supervisory plan that covers an agreed upon
period and provides for an effective and efficient supervision process
tailored to the Multi-State Bank's organizational structure and risk
profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing and updating the comprehensive supervisory
plan, the Responsible Federal Agency and the Home State Supervisor
will consider the views of the Local Federal Reserve Banks, the Local
FDIC Regional Offices and the Host State Supervisors, as appropriate.
The comprehensive supervisory plan will include: <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>A risk assessment of the organization;  <br>
<p>
<li>The examination plan described in Section II.D. of this
Agreement; <br>
<p>
<li>Schedules for examination planning meetings; <br>
<p>
<li>Estimated resource requirements for conducting on-site
examinations; <br>
<p>
<li>Review and assessment of pending issues, such as the
status of applications and compliance with enforcement
actions; <br>
<p>
<li>Off-site monitoring plans; and <br>
<p>
<li>Such other matters as are necessary to promote the
safety and soundness of the organization. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<li>The Primary Contact Persons will ensure that, as part of the
comprehensive supervisory plan, a written examination plan is
developed that details the type, timing and location of on-site safety
and soundness and specialty<a href="#Footnote10" title="Footnote 10" name="Footref10"><SUP>10</SUP></a> examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The examination plan will
take into consideration the risk profile of the organization, its
structure, and managerial preferences concerning certain aspects of
the examination process (i.e., a preference for a series of target
examinations versus a preference for all on-site examinations to be
conducted simultaneously), and each agency's on-site examination
cycle mandates.&nbsp;&nbsp;In tailoring the supervisory program, the examination
plan will take into consideration the organization's internal
control/compliance functions, as well as the external audit, as
appropriate. <br>
<p>
<li>Safety and soundness examinations will generally be conducted on a
joint basis.<a href="#Footnote11" title="Footnote 11" name="Footref11"><SUP>11</SUP></a>  A joint examination will be conducted by an examination
team comprised of representatives from both agencies which will issue
a single examination report.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>
<p>
<li>Notwithstanding the above provisions, the Responsible Federal
Agency or the Home State Supervisor may conduct independent or
special examinations in exceptional circumstances.<a href="#Footnote12" title="Footnote 12" name="Footref12"><SUP>12</SUP></a>  The regulator
initiating the independent or special examination will make every effort
to provide appropriate notice to the other regulators prior to
commencing the examination. <br>
<p>
<li>The Responsible Federal Agency and the Home State Supervisor may
agree to have one examiner-in-charge (the &quot;EIC&quot;) or may each assign
a co-EIC to manage the on-site, joint examination.&nbsp;&nbsp;All necessary steps
will be taken to ensure that all aspects of the examination process are
fully coordinated and that duplication is avoided.<a href="#Footnote13" title="Footnote 13" name="Footref13"><SUP>13</SUP></a>  <br>
<p>
The Primary Contact Persons and/or the EICs, as appropriate, will
meet to: <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>Develop the examination focus and scope;<br>
<p>
<li>Develop procedures for compiling off-site and on-site
examination-related information; <br>
<p>
<li>Develop a joint entry letter to be sent in a timely manner
prior to the start of the examination that requests
essential information and materials, preferably internal
bank reports, for off-site review, thereby minimizing on-site efforts and their associated burden; <br>
<p>
<li>Determine appropriate staffing levels and assign
responsibilities for examination staff; <br>
<p>
<li>Develop procedures for coordinating information requests
during the examination;  <br>
<p>
<li>Schedule meetings with management; and <br>
<p>
<li>Determine a format for the examination report and assign
responsibilities for writing and processing the examination
report, including timeframes for completion, as required
by Sections&nbsp;II.H. and II.I of this Agreement. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<li>All examiners involved in an examination will perform the
responsibilities assigned and promptly report the findings, conclusions
and recommendations in the form requested, together with supporting
papers to the EIC or their agency's co-EIC. <br>
<p>
<li>The examination report will be prepared using an agreed-upon format
and will be forwarded to the institution within 45 calendar days from
the close of the examination, which is the date of the exit interview
with management.&nbsp;&nbsp;The exit interviews will take place within 15
calendar days from the close of all on-site activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><font size = +1><li>Supervisory Actions</font></b>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<li>The Parties will, in all cases, consult one another regarding
investigations and supervisory actions involving a Multi-State Bank. <br>
<p>
<li>When the Responsible Federal Agency and the Home State Supervisor
jointly deem that a follow-up supervisory action against a Multi-State
Bank is warranted, both agencies will consult one another and
coordinate the drafting and implementation. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><font size = +1><li>Supervisory Information</b></font>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<li>Consistent with the goal of seamless supervision, any information
provided by a Party to another Party will be treated as confidential
supervisory information, unless otherwise specified by the providing
Party, and will remain the property of the providing Party.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Party will
use confidential supervisory information only for purposes directly
related to its supervisory responsibilities. <br>
<p>
<li>The Responsible Federal Agency may disclose to Local Federal
