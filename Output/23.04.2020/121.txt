<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination 
   of the Regulatory Reports Monitoring Program and 
   New Procedures for Monitoring Regulatory Reports</div>
<!-- single space -->
<p>The Federal Reserve is terminating the Regulatory 
   Reports Monitoring Program, under which the Board 
   used various monitoring, reporting, and consultation 
   requirements to identify banking organizations' noncompliance 
   with their filing obligations. As a result, this 
   letter supersedes previously issued supervisory guidance 
   on this program (SR&nbsp;letters 93-38, 93-47, 94-4, 
   and&nbsp;95-9). </p>
<p>Notwithstanding the termination of the Program, Reserve 
   Banks should continue to monitor the filing of all 
   regulatory reports, including those submitted under 
   the Home Mortgage Disclosure&nbsp;Act, to ensure 
   that they are filed in a timely manner and are accurate 
   and not misleading. The Federal Reserve System's 
   Committee on Current Reporting Series, which represents 
   staff from the statistics functions from each of 
   the Reserve Banks and the Board, will continue to 
   play an active role in this process. </p> 
<div class="SectionHeader">Background</div>
<p>The Regulatory Reports Monitoring Program was started 
   in 1992 to address the statutory requirement that 
   banking organizations file timely, accurate, and 
   non-misleading regulatory reports and to ensure a 
   consistent approach to supervisory actions and sanctions 
   associated with late, false or misleading filings. 
   Under the program, the Federal Reserve developed 
   and maintained an ongoing monitoring system to record 
   the timeliness of regulatory reports and to identify 
   those banking institutions that exhibited a pattern 
   of late or false reporting. </p>
<p>The Program was implemented in two&nbsp;phases. In 
   SR letter&nbsp;92-38, dated October&nbsp;15,&nbsp;1992, 
   the first&nbsp;phase of the Program required the 
   Reserve Banks to maintain monitoring systems capable 
   of identifying and maintaining records of institutions 
   that filed late reports. The Program required the 
   Reserve Banks to submit to the Board summary reports 
   of late reporters after each reporting period. The 
   reports were reviewed by Board staff and appropriate 
   follow-up actions were taken. To ensure consistent 
   treatment of reporters' requests for extensions of 
   time to file reports, the Reserve Banks were required 
   to consult with Board staff prior to authorizing 
   extensions. Extensions of due dates for the 
   filing of regulatory reports were not allowed unless 
   there were mitigating circumstances.</p>
<p>In SR&nbsp;letter 93-47, dated August&nbsp;13,&nbsp;1993, 
   the second&nbsp;phase of the Program required the 
   Reserve Banks to monitor regulatory reports for accuracy 
   and completeness in addition to timeliness, to contact 
   reporters who submitted inaccurate or incomplete 
   filings, and to submit reports to Board staff concerning 
   any identified regulatory reporting deficiencies. 
   The second&nbsp;phase also added the requirement 
   for Reserve Banks to monitor compliance with banking 
   organizations' annual reporting requirements under 
   the Home Mortgage Disclosure&nbsp;Act and to submit 
   annual reports on the timeliness, completeness, and 
   accuracy of HMDA reports to Board staff. In SR&nbsp;letter 
   94-4, dated January&nbsp;14,&nbsp;1994, the Federal 
   Reserve issued procedures to track whether HMDA reports 
   are filed in a timely manner and whether they are 
   both complete and error free. </p>
<p>SR letter&nbsp;95-9, dated February&nbsp;28,&nbsp;1995, 
   modified the Program to reflect the generally satisfactory 
   level of compliance by banking organizations with 
   regulatory reporting requirements. Reserve Banks 
   were no longer required to make quarterly submissions 
   to the Board, but were still required to identify 
   late and false reporters. In addition, Reserve Banks 
   were still required to submit annual reports of late 
   and false HMDA reporters and to consult with Board 
   staff prior to granting extensions of time for filing 
   reports. </p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Termination of Program 
   and Revised Procedures</div>
<p>Since the implementation of the Regulatory Reports 
   Monitoring Program, Federal Reserve staff has found 
   that banking organizations have consistently been 
   fulfilling their legal obligations related to regulatory 
   reports and that they have rarely missed filing deadlines, 
   or submitted inaccurate or misleading information 
   in their regulatory reports. Where serious problems 
   were identified, banking organizations re-filed the 
   appropriate reports and, in some cases, provisions 
   related to regulatory report filing obligations were 
   included in formal and informal enforcement actions. 
</p>
<p>Board staff has determined that, in light of the 
   high level of compliance by state member banks, bank 
   holding companies, and the U.S.&nbsp;branches and 
   agencies of foreign banks with their regulatory report 
   filing requirements, it is appropriate to reduce 
   the administrative burden on the Reserve Banks by 
   eliminating the Regulatory Reports Monitoring Program. 
   This means that Reserve Banks are no longer required 
   to submit reports to Board staff on late and false 
   reporters. In addition, there is no further need 
   for the Reserve Banks to submit requests to Board 
   staff for extensions of time to file reports. It 
   is expected that the Committee on Current Reporting 
   Series will establish procedures for the Reserve 
   Banks to follow in granting extensions of time to 
   file reports and will issue whatever guidance may 
   be necessary in this area to ensure continued consistency 
   among the Reserve Banks. </p>
<p>The staff of the Board's Division of Community and 
   Consumer Affairs will continue to be responsible 
   for the oversight of HMDA reports. DCCA staff, assisted 
   by the Board's Information Technology Division, will 
   continue to monitor the timeliness and accuracy of 
   HMDA reports as part of its supervisory function. 
</p>
<p>The staff of the Enforcement Section of the Division 
   of Banking Supervision and Regulation will continue 
   to work with the Reserve Banks in the event that 
   regulatory report filing deficiencies or violations 
   are discovered. Serious problems in this area should 
   be referred to the Enforcement Section staff for 
   appropriate follow-up corrective action. Enforcement 
   Section staff will coordinate with DCCA if the problems 
   relate to HMDA filings. </p>
<p>In the event that you have any questions concerning 
   any of these matters, please contact Joan&nbsp;Wolff, 
   Counsel, Enforcement Section, at (202)&nbsp;728-5881; 
   Robert&nbsp;Maahs, Manager, Regulatory Reports Section, 
   at (202)&nbsp;872-4935; or John&nbsp;Bell, CCRS Chair, 
   Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, 
   at (215)&nbsp;574-6442.</p>
