   AT EACH FEDERAL RESERVE BANK</div>				
<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhancement 
   to the Name Check Process Related to Applications 
   Reviewed by the Federal Reserve</div>
<p>In connection with its review of various applications 
   and notices, the Federal Reserve has had a longstanding 
   policy of conducting name checks with law enforcement 
   and other government authorities on certain individuals 
   associated with a proposed transaction.&nbsp; Name 
   checks have generally been performed on significant 
   shareholders and key policymakers who are not well 
   known to U.S.&nbsp;bank or thrift regulators, and 
   in special circumstances particular to some applications. 
   These checks enable the collection of information 
   about individuals that may be useful in the Federal 
   Reserve's review of the financial resources, experience, 
   integrity, and competence of persons associated with 
   a banking organization, as well as in the Federal 
   Reserve's assessment of whether the individuals can 
   lead the organization in a safe and sound manner.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has worked with the Federal Bureau 
   of Investigation on an enhancement to the System's 
   current name check process that will enable the Federal 
   Reserve to obtain from the FBI more accurate and 
   current information relating to arrests and convictions. 
   This new process necessitates the use of fingerprints 
   from individuals who are subject to name checks in 
   the applications process. The use of fingerprinting 
   as a security measure has become significantly more 
   widespread and accepted, and advances in fingerprinting 
   technology have been made with respect to the speed 
   with which such checks can be completed.</p>
<p>There are currently two methods by which fingerprints 
   can be provided to the Federal Reserve &#150; a &quot;Live-Scan&quot; 
   terminal or a fingerprint card. A Live-Scan terminal 
   allows fingerprints to be obtained in digital format 
   and sent to the FBI electronically. Eight of the 
   12&nbsp;Reserve Banks currently have Live-Scan capability, 
   and individuals can choose to visit one of these 
   Reserve Banks to submit their fingerprints.<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
   The second method of submitting fingerprints is through 
   fingerprint cards, which are completed manually at 
   various law enforcement locations and sent via mail 
   for processing. If it is not convenient to visit 
   a Reserve Bank to use a Live-Scan terminal, an individual 
   will be requested to complete a fingerprint card. 
   The completed card will be sealed by law enforcement 
   in an envelope supplied by the Reserve Bank and mailed 
   to the address that is pre-printed on the envelope. 
   The attached Letter of Instruction for Applicants 
   provides more detailed information on the submission 
   of fingerprints.</p>
<p>The new fingerprint requirement has not changed the 
   Federal Reserve's overall process for determining 
   whether an individual will be subject to&nbsp;name 
   checks for a particular filing. During the applications 
   process, Reserve Banks will identify persons who 
   need to be fingerprinted, and send to such persons 
   blank fingerprint cards and return envelopes, as 
   well as the attached Letter of Instruction. To meet 
   all relevant processing timeframes and avoid delay, 
   it will be necessary for fingerprints to be submitted 
   as expeditiously as possible (either through Live-Scan 
   or mail). The use of a Live-Scan terminal, where 
   available, will significantly expedite the name check 
   process.</p>
<p>To the extent possible, the fingerprint process should 
   commence prior to submission of an application or 
   notice. Such an approach requires early consultation 
   with Reserve Bank staff by relevant parties, the 
   submission of <i>Interagency Biographical and Financial 
   Reports</i> on a pre-filing basis, and the prompt 
   identification by Reserve Banks of persons that require 
   fingerprints.<a href="#Footnote2" name="Footref2" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
   Reserve Banks should emphasize to the affected individuals 
   and applicants that failure to expeditiously complete 
   the fingerprinting process could result in a delay 
   on the related application.</p>
<p>All applications received after June&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2003 
   are subject to the new procedure.<a href="#Footnote3" name="Footref3" title="Footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
   Fingerprint cards or Live-Scan fingerprints must 
   be obtained on each relevant person meeting the name 
   check criteria associated with an application or 
   notice received after June&nbsp;30.</p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this SR&nbsp;letter 
   to staff involved in the applications process and 
   to other supervisory staff. Questions regarding the 
   use of fingerprints may be directed to Len&nbsp;Zawistowski, 
   Senior Special Investigator, at (202)&nbsp;452-6488, 
   or David&nbsp;Reilly, Senior Supervisory Financial 
   Analyst, at (202)&nbsp;452-5214. </p>

      <li><a name="Footnote1"></a>The Federal Reserve 
         Banks of Boston, New&nbsp;York, Philadelphia, 
         Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and 
         San&nbsp;Francisco currently have Live-Scan 
         terminals. The remaining four Reserve Banks 
         expect to have Live-Scan terminals in the near 
         future. Individuals can only use Live-Scan 
         terminals at the Reserve Banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref1">Return&nbsp;to&nbsp;text</a></li>
