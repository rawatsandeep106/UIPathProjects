<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Interagency Guidance on Response Programs
  for Unauthorized Access to Customer Information and Customer Notice</div>
<p>This joint Supervision and Regulation and Consumer Affairs Letter establishes
  the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s expectations for financial institutions and supervisory
  personnel with respect to the <i>Interagency Guidance on Response Programs
  for Unauthorized Access to Customer Information and Customer Notice</i>&nbsp;(Guidance),
  which became effective upon publication in the <i>Federal Register</i> on
March&nbsp;29,&nbsp;2005.<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The Guidance
  interprets the <i>Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security
  Standards</i> (Security&nbsp;Guidelines)<a href="#Footnote2" name="Footref2" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a> and
  states that each financial institution should implement a response program
  to address unauthorized access to customer information maintained by the institution
  or its service providers.<a href="#Footnote3" name="Footref3" title="Footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a> The
  Guidance describes the components of a response program, including procedures
  to notify customers about incidents that involve unauthorized access to <i>sensitive</i> customer
  information.</p>
<p>Sensitive customer information means a customer&rsquo;s name, address, or
  telephone number, in conjunction with the customer&rsquo;s social security
  number, driver&rsquo;s license number, account number, credit or debit card
  number, or a personal identification number or password that would permit
  access to the customer&rsquo;s account. Sensitive customer information
  also includes any combination of components of customer information that would
  allow someone to log onto or access the customer&rsquo;s account, such as
  user name and password or password and account number.</p>
<p>The Guidance
  provides that when a financial institution becomes aware of an incident of
  unauthorized access to sensitive customer information, the institution should
  conduct a reasonable investigation to promptly determine the likelihood that
  the information has been or will be misused. If the institution determines
  that misuse of its information about a customer has occurred or is reasonably
  possible, it should notify the affected customer as soon as possible. Notice
  may be delayed if an appropriate law enforcement agency determines that notification
  will interfere with a criminal investigation and provides the institution
  with a written request for a delay.</p>
<p>The Guidance
  also provides that a financial institution should notify its primary federal
  regulator of a security breach involving sensitive customer information, whether
  or not the institution notifies its customers. A financial institution
  experiencing such a breach should promptly notify its supervisory central
  point of contact at its Reserve&nbsp;Bank and provide information on the nature
  of the incident and on whether law enforcement authorities were notified or
  a Suspicious Activity Report&nbsp;(SAR) was or will be filed. When reporting
  security breaches involving sensitive customer information, an institution
  should provide the central point of contact with information on the steps
  taken to contain and control the incident, the number of customers potentially
  affected, whether customer notification is warranted, and whether a service
  provider was involved. A financial institution should not delay providing
  prompt initial notification to its central point of contact.</p>
<p>When evaluating
  the adequacy of a financial institution&rsquo;s information security program
  required by the Security Guidelines, the Federal Reserve will consider whether
  the bank has developed and implemented a response program including notification
  procedures as described in the Guidance.&nbsp; An institution&rsquo;s response
  program should contain procedures for the following:</p>
<ol class="indent">
  <li>Assessing the nature and scope of an incident and identifying what customer
    information systems and types of customer information have been accessed
    or misused;</li>
  <li>Notifying the institution&rsquo;s primary federal regulator as
    soon as possible once the institution becomes aware of an incident involving
    unauthorized access to or use of sensitive customer information;</li>
  <li>Complying
    with applicable suspicious activity reporting regulations and guidance to
  ensure appropriate law enforcement authorities are notified in a timely manner;</li>
  <li>Taking appropriate steps to contain and control the incident to prevent
    further unauthorized access to or use of customer information, for example,
    by monitoring, freezing, or closing affected accounts; and</li>
  <li>Notifying customers
    as soon as possible when it is determined that misuse of sensitive customer
    information has occurred or is reasonably possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Guidance states that a financial institution&rsquo;s contract with each
  service provider should require the service provider to take appropriate actions
  to address incidents of unauthorized access to the financial institution&rsquo;s
  customer information, including notification to the institution as soon as
  possible of any such incident, to enable the institution to expeditiously
  implement its response program. While the Guidance states that it is the responsibility
  of the financial institution to notify the institution&rsquo;s primary regulator,
  an institution may authorize or contract with its service provider to notify
  the institution&rsquo;s regulator of a security incident on its behalf. </p>
<p>When evaluating the adequacy of a financial institution&rsquo;s information
  security program or a specific security breach incident, the Federal Reserve
  will take into account the good faith efforts made by each financial institution
  to develop a response program that is consistent with the Guidance, together
  with all other relevant circumstances. The Federal Reserve may treat
  a financial institution&rsquo;s failure to implement the Guidance as an unsafe
and unsound practice.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of notification of a security breach, unauthorized access, or
  misuse of sensitive customer information, Reserve Banks should notify appropriate
  Board staff if it has been determined that misuse of the information has occurred
  or is reasonably possible and customer notification will likely be required.
  Board staff will follow the progress of the incident and will utilize this
  information to inform future supervisory guidance and identify trends in information
  security developments. </p>
<p>This supervisory letter should be distributed to the appropriate management
  personnel at financial institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve. If
  you have any questions concerning this Guidance, please contact Stacy&nbsp;Coleman,
  Assistant Director, Operational and IT Risk Section, at (202)&nbsp;452-2934,
  Suzanne&nbsp;Killian, Assistant Director for Reserve Bank Oversight, at (202)&nbsp;452-2090,
  or John&nbsp;Gibbons, Supervisory Financial Analyst, at (202)&nbsp;452-6409. </p>
