   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Regulation&nbsp;H sets forth the requirements for state chartered banks' membership in 
   the Federal Reserve System and imposes certain conditions of membership on applicant 
   banks.&nbsp; Under the regulation, a member bank must &quot;at all times conduct its 
   business and exercise its powers with due regard to safety and soundness&quot; and 
   &quot;may not, without the permission of the Board, cause or permit any change in the 
   general character of its business or in the scope of the corporate powers it exercises 
   at the time of admission to membership.&quot; (Refer to 12&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;208.3(d)(1) 
   and&nbsp;(2))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The purpose of this letter is to remind both Reserve Bank examiners and state member 
   banks of the requirement in Regulation&nbsp;H that state member banks must receive 
   the prior approval of the Board before making any significant change in business 
   plans.&nbsp; In view of the trend toward more diverse, complex and, at times, riskier 
   activities of some banks, the prior approval requirements of Regulation H have become 
   more important.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Changes in the general character of a bank's business would include, for example, 
   becoming a primarily Internet-focused or Internet-only operation, or concentrating 
   solely on subprime lending or leasing activities.&nbsp; These activities can present 
   novel risks for banking organizations, depending on how they are conducted and managed, 
   and may also present risks to the deposit insurance fund.&nbsp; In many cases, these 
   activities involve aggressive growth plans and may give rise to significant financial, 
   managerial, and other supervisory issues.&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   In applications for membership in the Federal Reserve System, careful consideration is 
   given to a bank's proposed business plan in order to ensure, at a minimum, that 
   appropriate financial and managerial standards are met.&nbsp; Likewise, the other 
   federal banking agencies consider a bank's business plan when they review applications 
   for federal deposit insurance, in the case of the FDIC, or a national bank or federal 
   thrift charter, in the case of the OCC and OTS.&nbsp; The OCC, FDIC, and OTS have been 
   conditioning their approvals of applications to require that, during the first three 
   years of operations, the bank or thrift provide prior notice or obtain prior approval 
   of any proposed significant deviations or changes from its original operating 
   plan.&nbsp; Rather than use similar commitments, the Federal Reserve has relied on the 
   provisions of Regulation&nbsp;H cited above in order to address situations where a 
   state member bank proposes to materially change its core business plan.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Federal Reserve supervisors will be monitoring changes in the general character of the 
   business of state member banks as part of the normal supervisory process to ensure 
   compliance with the requirements of Regulation&nbsp;H and with safe and sound banking 
   practices.&nbsp; This review should be conducted on at least an annual basis by the 
   Reserve Bank.&nbsp; A significant change in a bank's business plan without the Board's 
   prior approval would be considered a violation of Regulation H and would be addressed 
   through follow-up supervisory action.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this letter to all state member banks in their 
   districts, as well as their examination staff.&nbsp; Should you have any questions 
   regarding this letter, please contact Michael&nbsp;O'Rourke, Counsel, Legal Division, 
   at (202)&nbsp;452-3288 or Betsy&nbsp;Cross, Deputy Associate Director, at 
   (202)&nbsp;452-2574.</P>
