<B>Overview</B>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking organizations are increasingly becoming exposed
to liability associated with the clean-up of hazardous substance
contamination pursuant to the federal superfund statute.<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></a>  The
superfund statute is the primary federal law dealing with
hazardous substance contamination.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are numerous
other federal statutes, as well as state statutes, that establish
environmental liability that could place banking organizations at
risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the superfund statute was enacted a decade ago,
it has been only since the mid-1980s that court actions have
resulted in some banking organizations being held liable for the
clean-up of hazardous substance contamination.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this
connection, recent court decisions have had a wide array of
interpretations as to whether banking organizations are owners or
operators of contaminated facilities, and thereby liable under
the superfund statute for clean-up costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;This has led to
uncertainty on the part of banking organizations as to how to
best protect themselves from environmental liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking organizations may encounter losses arising from
environmental liability in several ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of greatest concern are
situations where banking organizations may be held directly
liable for cleaning-up hazardous substance contamination.
However, the more common situation has been where banking
organizations have elected to abandon their rights to
contaminated real property collateral because clean-up costs
exceed balances owed by borrowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk of credit losses can also arise where the credit
quality of individual borrowers deteriorates markedly as a result
of being required to clean-up hazardous substance contamination.
In this case, significant clean-up costs borne by the borrower
could threaten the borrower's solvency and jeopardize the banking
organization's ultimate collection of outstanding loans to that
borrower.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, even advances to borrowers to fund
operations or to acquire manufacturing or transportation
equipment could be adversely impacted by environmental liability
regardless of the fact that no real property collateral is
involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<B>Banking Organizations' Environmental Policies and Procedures</B>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking organizations should have in place adequate
safeguards and controls to limit their exposure to potential
environmental liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Loan policies and procedures should
address methods for identifying potential environmental problems
relating to credit requests as well as existing loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;The loan
policy should describe an appropriate degree of due diligence
investigation required for credit requests.&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowers in high-risk industries or localities should be held to a more stringent
due diligence investigation than borrowers in low-risk industries
or localities.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to establishing procedures for
granting credit, procedures should be developed and applied to
portfolio analysis, credit monitoring, loan workout situations,
and--prior to taking title to real property--foreclosures.&nbsp;&nbsp;At
the same time, banking organizations must be careful that the
actions undertaken to make, administer, and collect loans--including assessing and controlling environmental liability--cannot be construed as taking an active role in participating in
the management or day-to-day operations of the borrower's
business, which could lead to potential liability under CERCLA.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking organizations should take steps to avoid or
mitigate potential environmental liability by:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<ol>
<li>Preparing an environmental policy statement and
providing training programs so lending personnel
are aware of environmental liability issues and
are able to identify borrowers with potential
problems.
<p>
<li>Establishing guidelines and procedures for dealing
with new borrowers and real property offered as
collateral.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<li>Conducting an appropriate analysis of potential
environmental liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such analysis should be
more rigorous as the risk of hazardous substance
contamination increases.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are
examples of types of analyses and procedures that
should be progressively considered as the risk of
environmental liability increases:
<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Environmental review--screening of the
borrower's activities by lending personnel or
real estate appraisers for potential
environmental problems (using questionnaires,
interviews, or observations).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
Review procedures might include a survey of
past ownership and uses of the property, a
property inspection, a review of adjacent or
contiguous parcels of property, a review of
company records for past use or disposal of
hazardous materials, and a review of any
relevant Environmental Protection Agency
records.
<p>
<li>Environmental assessment--structured analysis
by a <B>qualified</B> individual that identifies the
borrower's past practices, regulatory
compliance, and potential future problems.
This analysis would include reviewing
relevant documents, visiting and inspecting
the site, and, in some cases, performing
limited tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<li>Environmental audit--a professional
environmental engineer performs a similar
structured analysis as previously indicated
for &quot;environmental assessments,&quot; however,
more comprehensive testing might involve
collecting and analyzing air samples, surface
soil samples, subsurface soil samples, or
drilling wells to sample ground water.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</ol>
<p>
<li>Reviewing existing loans to identify credits
having potential environmental problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<li>Developing recordkeeping procedures to document
the due diligence efforts taken at the time of
making loans or acquiring real property.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<li>Including warranties, representations, and
indemnifications in loan agreements designed to
protect the banking organization from losses
stemming from hazardous substance contamination.
(Although such provisions provide some protection
for the lender, these agreements are not binding
against the government or third parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such
contractual protections are only as secure as the
borrower's financial strength.)
</ol>
<p>
<B>Examination Procedures</B>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners should review a banking organization's loan
policies and procedures to ensure that they incorporate adequate
safeguards and controls to minimize potential environmental
liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;When reviewing individual credits, examiners should
determine that the loan policy has been complied with,
particularly where the borrower's activities or industry are
associated with hazardous substances or environmental liability.
In addition, for situations involving potential environmental
liability arising from a banking organization's nonlending
activities, examiners should verify that similar policies and
procedures are in place.<a href="#Footnote2" title="Footnote 2" name="Footref2"><SUP>2</SUP></a>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enclosed is a brief discussion paper (suitable for
distribution) on environmental liability, including its impact on
the activities of banking organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper is intended
to provide examiners and bankers with an overview of the issues
surrounding environmental liability, and to assist them in
evaluating the measures taken by banking organizations to
identify and minimize potential environmental liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
proposed revised regulations (Federal Register Notice 56 FR
28798, 6/24/91) providing further guidance on the secured lender
exemption under the superfund statue.&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed regulation is
designed to provide secured lenders with a more specific
exemption from environmental liability including a better
definition of the scope of the exemption and a definition of
active participation in management.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, bills are
pending in Congress which would further define the scope and
requirements of the secured lender exemption.&nbsp;&nbsp;Board staff will
issue further guidance on the proposed regulation or legislation
and their impact on lender liability once these proposals are
final.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interim, questions or comments about the foregoing
should be directed to Stanley Rediger, Supervisory Financial
Analyst (202-452-2629), or Bill Spaniel, Senior Financial Analyst
(202-452-3469).

Background
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1980, the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (&quot;CERCLA&quot;) was enacted in response
to the growing problem of improper handling and disposal of
hazardous substances.&nbsp;&nbsp;CERCLA authorizes the Environmental
Protection Agency (&quot;EPA&quot;) to clean-up hazardous waste sites and
to recover costs associated with the clean-up from entities
specified in the statute.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant provisions of CERCLA, the so-called
&quot;superfund&quot; statute, as it pertains to banking organizations,
indicate which persons or entities are subject to liability for
clean-up costs of hazardous substance contamination.&nbsp;&nbsp;These
include &quot;. . . the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility,
(or) any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous
substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous
substances were disposed of . . . .&quot;<a href="#Footnote3" title="Footnote 3" name="Footref3"><SUP>3</SUP></a>  A person or entity that
transports or arranges to transport hazardous substances can also
be held liable for cleaning-up contamination under the superfund
statute.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liability imposed by the superfund statute is
strict liability which means the government does not have to
prove that the owners or operators had knowledge of or caused the
hazardous substance contamination.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, liability is joint
and several, which allows the government to seek recovery of the
entire cost of the clean-up from any individual party that is
liable for those clean-up costs under CERCLA.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this
connection, CERCLA does not limit the bringing of such actions to
the EPA, but permits such actions to be brought by third parties.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CERCLA provides a secured creditor exemption in the
definition of &quot;owner and operator&quot; by stating that these terms do
not include &quot;. . . a person, who, without participating in the
management of a vessel or facility, holds indicia of ownership
primarily to protect his security interest in the vessel or
facility.&quot;<a href="#Footnote4" title="Footnote 4" name="Footref4"><SUP>4</SUP></a>  However, this exception has not provided banking
organizations with an effective &quot;safe harbor&quot; because recent
court decisions have worked to limit the application of this
exemption.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, courts have held that actions by
lenders to protect their security interests may result in the
banking organization &quot;participating in the management&quot; of a
vessel or facility, thereby voiding the exemption.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
once the title to a foreclosed property passes to the banking
organization, courts have held that the exemption no longer
applies and that the banking organization is liable under the
superfund statute as an &quot;owner&quot; of the property.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under some
circumstances, CERCLA may exempt landowners who acquire property
without the knowledge of preexisting conditions (the so-called
&quot;innocent landowner defense&quot;).&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the courts have applied
a stringent standard to qualify for this defense.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because little
guidance is provided by the statute as to what constitutes the
appropriate timing and degree of &quot;due diligence&quot; to successfully
employ this defense, banking organizations should exercise
caution before relying on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superfund statute is the primary federal law
dealing with the clean-up of hazardous substance contamination.
However, there are numerous other federal statutes as well as
state statutes that establish environmental liability that could
place banking organizations at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, underground
storage tanks are also covered by separate federal legislation.<a href="#Footnote5" title="Footnote 5" name="Footref5"><SUP>5</SUP></a>
<p>
<B>Overview of Environmental Hazards</B>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental risk can be characterized as adverse
consequences resulting from having generated or handled hazardous
substances, or otherwise having been associated with the
aftermath of subsequent contamination.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following discussion
highlights some common environmental hazards, but by no means
covers all environmental hazards.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazardous substance contamination is most often
associated with industrial or manufacturing processes that
involve chemicals or solvents in the manufacturing process or as
waste products.&nbsp;&nbsp;For years, these types of hazardous substances
were disposed of in land fills, or just dumped on industrial
sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazardous substances are also found in many other lines
of business.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following examples demonstrate the diverse
sources of potential hazardous substance contamination which
should be of concern to banking organizations:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Farmers and ranchers (use of fuel, fertilizers,
herbicides, insecticides, and feedlot runoff).
<p>
<li>Dry cleaners (various cleaning solvents).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<li>Service station and convenience store operators
(underground storage tanks).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<li>Fertilizer and chemical dealers and applicators
(storage and transportation of chemicals).
<p>
<li>Lawn care businesses (application of lawn
chemicals).
<p>
<li>Trucking firms (local and long haul transporters
of hazardous substances such as fuel or
chemicals).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real estate industry has taken the brunt of the
adverse affects of hazardous waste contamination.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to
having land contaminated with toxic substances, construction
methods for major construction projects, such as commercial
buildings, have utilized materials that have been subsequently
determined to be hazardous, resulting in significant declines in
their value.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, asbestos was commonly used in
commercial construction from the 1950s to the late 1970s.
Asbestos has since been found to be a health hazard and now must
meet certain federal and, in many instances, state requirements
for costly removal or abatement (enclosing or otherwise sealing
off).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another common source of hazardous substance
contamination is underground storage tanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaks in these tanks
not only contaminate the surrounding ground, but often flow into
ground water and travel far away from the original contamination
site.&nbsp;&nbsp;As contamination spreads to other sites, clean-up costs
escalate.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<B>Impact on Banking Organizations</B>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the greatest risk to banking organizations of
the superfund statute and other environmental liability statutes
is the possibility of being held solely liable for costly
environmental clean-ups.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a banking organization is found to
be a responsible party under CERCLA the banking organization may
find itself responsible for cleaning-up a contaminated site at a
cost that far exceeds any outstanding loan balance.&nbsp;&nbsp;This risk of
loss results from an interpretation of the superfund statute as
providing for joint and several liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any responsible
party, including the banking organization, could be forced to pay
the full cost of any clean-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the banking
organization may attempt to recover such costs from the borrower,
or the owner if different than the borrower, provided that the
borrower or owner continues in existence and is solvent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking
organizations may be held liable for the clean-up of hazardous
substance contamination in situations where the banking
organization:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Takes title to property pursuant to foreclosure;
<p>
<li>Involves the banking organization's personnel or
contractors engaged by the bank in day-to-day
management of the facility;
<p>
<li>Takes actions designed to make the contaminated
property salable, possibly resulting in further
contamination;
<p>
<li>Acts in a fiduciary capacity, including management
involvement in the day-to-day operations of
industrial or commercial concerns, and purchasing
or selling contaminated property;
<p>
<li>Owns existing, or acquires (by merger or
acquisition), subsidiaries involved in activities
that might result in a finding of environmental
liability;
<p>
<li>Owns existing, or acquires for future expansion,
premises that have been previously contaminated by
hazardous substances.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, site
contamination at a branch office where a service
station having underground storage tanks once
operated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, premises or other real estate
owned could be contaminated by asbestos requiring
costly clean-up or abatement.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A more common situation encountered by banking
organizations has been where real property collateral is found to
be contaminated by hazardous substances.&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of
contaminated real property collateral can decline dramatically,
depending on the degree of contamination.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the projected
clean-up costs increase, the borrower may not be able to provide
the necessary funds to remove contaminated materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;In making
its determination whether to foreclose, the banking organization
must estimate the potential clean-up costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;In many cases this
estimated cost has been found to be well in excess of the
outstanding loan balance, and the banking organization has
elected to abandon its security interest in the property and
write-off the loan.&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation occurs regardless of the fact
that the superfund statute provides a secured creditor exemption.
Some courts have not extended this exemption to situations where
banking organizations have taken title to a property pursuant to
foreclosure.&nbsp;&nbsp;These rulings have been based on a strict reading
of the statute that provides the exemption to &quot;security
interests&quot; only.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another risk to banking organizations resulting from
environmental liability stems from borrowers being operators,
generators, or transporters of hazardous substances.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking
organizations must be aware that a borrower's solvency can be
threatened by being found liable for cleaning-up hazardous
substance contamination.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, ultimate collection of loans
to fund operations, or to acquire manufacturing or transportation
equipment can be jeopardized by the borrower's generating or
handling hazardous substances in an improper manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further,
some bankruptcy courts have required clean-up of hazardous
substance contamination prior to distribution of a debtor's
estate to secured creditors.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowers may have existing subsidiaries or may be
involved in merger and acquisition activity that may place the
borrower at risk for the activities of others that result in
environmental liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some courts have held that for the
purposes of determining liability under the superfund statute,
the corporate veil may not protect parent companies that
participate in the day-to-day operations of their subsidiaries
from environmental liability and court imposed clean-up costs.
Additionally, borrowers can be held liable for contamination
which occurred prior to their owning or using real estate.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<B>Protection Against Environmental Liability</B>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking organizations have numerous ways to identify
and minimize their exposure to environmental liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
environmental liability is relatively recent, procedures used to
safeguard against such liability are evolving.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following
discussion briefly describes methods currently being employed by
banking organizations and others to minimize potential
environmental liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking organizations should have in place adequate
safeguards and controls to limit their exposure to potential
environmental liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Loan policies and procedures should
address methods for identifying potential environmental problems
relating to credit requests as well as existing loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;The loan
policy should describe an appropriate degree of due diligence
investigation required for credit requests.&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowers in high-risk industries or localities should be held to a more stringent
due diligence investigation than borrowers in low-risk industries
or localities.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to establishing procedures for
granting credit, procedures should be developed and applied to
portfolio analysis, credit monitoring, loan workout situations,
and--prior to taking title to real property--foreclosures.
Banking organizations may avoid or mitigate potential
environmental liability by having sound policies and procedures
designed to identify, assess and control environmental liability.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, banking organizations must be careful
that any lending policies and procedures, but especially those
undertaken to assess and control environmental liability, cannot
be construed as taking an active role in participating in the
management or day-to-day operations of the borrower's business.
Activities which could be considered active participation in the
management of the borrower's business, and therefore subject the
bank to potential liability, include, but are not limited to:
<p>
<ul>
<li>having bank employees as members of the borrower's
board of directors or actively participating in
board decisions;
<p>
<li>assisting in day-to-day management and operating
decisions; and
<p>
<li>actively determining management changes.
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These considerations are especially important when the
banking organization is actively involved in loan workouts or
debt restructuring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step in identifying and minimizing
environmental risk is for banking organizations to perform
environmental reviews.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such reviews may be performed by loan
officers or others, and typically identify past practices and
uses of the facility and property, evaluate regulatory
compliance, if applicable, and identify potential future
problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is accomplished by interviewing persons familiar
with present and past uses of the facility and property,
reviewing relevant records and documents, and visiting and
inspecting the site.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the environmental review reveals possible
hazardous substance contamination, an environmental assessment or
audit may be required.&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental assessments are made by
personnel trained in identifying potential environmental hazards
and provide a more through review and inspection of the facility
and property.&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental audits differ markedly from
environmental assessments in that independent environmental
engineers are employed to investigate, in greater detail, those
factors listed previously, and actually test for hazardous
substance contamination.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such testing might require collecting
and analyzing air samples, surface soil samples, subsurface soil
samples, or drilling wells to sample ground water.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other measures used by some banking organizations to
assist in identifying and minimizing environmental liability
include:&nbsp;&nbsp;obtaining indemnities from borrowers for any clean-up
costs incurred by the banking organization, and including
affirmative covenants in loan agreements (and attendant default
provisions) requiring the borrower to comply with all applicable
environmental regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these measures may provide
some aid in identifying and minimizing potential environmental
liability, they are not a substitute for environmental reviews,
assessments and audits, because their effectiveness is dependent
upon the financial strength of the borrower.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<p>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential environmental liability can touch on a great
number of loans to borrowers in many industries or localities.
Moreover, nonlending activities as well as corporate affiliations
can lead to environmental liability depending upon the nature of
the these activities and the degree of participation that the
parent exercises in the operations of its subsidiaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such
liability can result in losses arising from hazardous substance
contamination because banking organizations are held directly
liable for costly court ordered clean-ups.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the
banking organization's ability to collect the loans it makes may
be hampered by significant declines in collateral value, or the
inability of a borrower to meet debt payments after paying for
costly clean-ups of hazardous substance contamination.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking organizations must understand the nature of
environmental liability arising from hazardous substance
contamination.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, they should take prudential steps
to identify and minimize their potential environmental liability.
Indeed, the common thread to environmental liability is the
existence of hazardous substances, not types of borrowers, lines
of business, or real property.
