&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent changes in the nature and complexity of fiduciary activities,
both in the United States and abroad, have underscored the need to revise the
focus and emphasis of fiduciary examinations in order to assess better a banking
organization's ability to manage effectively the risks associated with fiduciary
activities and ensure the prudent conduct of those activities.  The changes include
rapid growth in fee-based products and service globalization, the increasing
dependence on new information systems and communications technologies,
whether developed in-house or outsourced, and the heightened demand in the
fiduciary area for more sophisticated investment products.  These changes have, to
some extent, diminished the line separating commercial banking and fiduciary
activities.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve's fiduciary examinations have traditionally
focused on risks associated with compliance, financial management and operations,
and the fiduciary's duty of undivided loyalty to the trust beneficiaries.  Much of the
examination was oriented to specific transactions and their compliance with
statutory or regulatory requirements where noncompliance could result in defined
penalties such as those authorized by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.  The
financial management and operations review focused on activities associated with
possible financial losses that occur due to error, omission, fraud or accident that
result from lost securities, misappropriation of funds, and mispostings, for example.
Some fiduciary risk arises from the potential that a fiduciary could violate its duty
of loyalty to the trust's principals or beneficiaries resulting in possible losses to the
fiduciary from settlements and litigation.  For example, the improper use of trust
assets, possibly for personal gain, and improper or unsuitable investment decisions
can expose the fiduciary to material loss or litigation.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the changes in the industry noted above, the Federal Reserve's
fiduciary examination current focus is being expanded to look more intensively at
risk management practices and related aspects of a banking organization's trust
activities.  This will result in, among other things, (1) greater use of a more
diversified examiner population including those with capital markets, information
systems, and safety and soundness experience<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, (2) a stronger emphasis on an
assessment of the individual organization's unique risk profile, and (3) a thorough
review of risk identification, measurement, monitoring and control.  This enhanced
focus is consistent with the guidance provided to examiners and distributed to
state member banks and bank holding companies in SR 95-51, issued  November
14, 1995, &quot;Rating the Adequacy of Risk Management Processes and Internal
Controls at State Member Banks and Bank Holding Companies.&quot;  The letter calls for
the rating of a bank's risk management practices taking into consideration credit,
market, liquidity, operational, legal and reputational risks, all of which are pertinent
to fiduciary activities as well.  The attachment to that letter indicates that a bank's
&quot;...risk management systems should also encompass the organization's trust and
fiduciary activities...&quot;<a href="#Footnote2" title="Footnote 2" name="Footref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the need to enhance the examination process in order to
adapt to these changes, a System Task Force on Reengineering Trust Supervision
has developed a fiduciary examination approach that is more intensively focused on
evaluating risk, assessing management's internal controls to limit risk, and
integrating both the pre-planning, assessment stage and the on-site findings into
the overall safety and soundness evaluation of a banking organization.  In designing
this approach, particular attention was directed to ensuring that examiners continue
to emphasize the unique nature of the risks inherent in fiduciary activities as they
relate to the fiduciary's &quot;duty of undivided loyalty&quot; to the trust customer which
requires placing the interests of the customer above those of the institution.<br>
<p>
<b>Risk Profile of Fiduciary Activities</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk-focused fiduciary examination and supervision process
centers around the preparation and upkeep of individualized risk profiles by the
Reserve Bank for organizations that engage in a significant volume of fiduciary
activities<a href="#Footnote3" title="Footnote 3" name="Footref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.  The appropriate scope of the fiduciary examination, particularly for the
largest banking organizations, would be influenced by an assessment of the
information contained in the risk profiles<a href="#Footnote4" title="Footnote 4" name="Footref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.  Where appropriate, coordinated
interdistrict examiner pooling arrangements or other System initiatives would be
used to provide the most effective resources to address the particular fiduciary
risks and safety and soundness risks within the banking organization.
Examinations would focus resources on the activities that pose the most
substantive risk as detailed in each institution's profile and would be influenced by
prior examination findings as well.  In this way, it is expected that a more thorough
understanding of each institution's unique risks and risk controls will develop.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banking organization's efforts to identify, measure, monitor and
control risk through implementation of specific policies, procedures, internal
controls and management information systems will then be assessed and tested
during the examination.  Conclusions should be discussed with bank management,
and, in the case of the more complex institutions at a minimum, should be
incorporated into the safety and soundness report of examination.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in SR 95-51, and consistent with the greater emphasis
given to risk management in Federal Reserve examination and supervisory policy
statements, System examiners have been asked to assign a rating for risk
management practices and assign that rating significant weight when evaluating
the banking organization's management.  Similarly, effective with the
commencement of new examinations, trust examiners are instructed to assign a
formal supervisory rating to an institution's risk management processes including
its internal controls pertaining to fiduciary activities<a href="#Footnote5" title="Footnote 5" name="Footref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.  The specific rating of risk
management and internal controls should be given significant weight when
evaluating the &quot;Supervision and Organization&quot; component as part of the overall
trust rating<a href="#Footnote6" title="Footnote 6" name="Footref6"><sup>6</sup></a>.<br>
<p>
<b>Risk Focus</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the adoption of the System's risk-focused examination approach
for fiduciary activities, it is anticipated that in a complex institution, fiduciary
examiners will direct more of their attention to assessing the organization's
functions and its ability to identify, measure, monitor and control fiduciary, market,
credit and operational risks.  In particular, examiners should assess risks that result
from the fiduciary's investment management, investment advisory, mutual funds,
global custody, and securities lending and processing activities, and any other
activities that are subject to adverse movements in market rates or prices, or to
operating problems associated with processing a large volume of securities.  These
fiduciary activities could result in material losses to trust customers and, in turn,
expose the institution to financial losses and litigation if not conducted in a manner
consistent with the fiduciary's duty of loyalty and the investor's stated objectives.
Recently, some of these fiduciary activities conducted at several large banking
organizations have led to actual or potential customer losses and, rather than
risking litigation or potentially exposing the organization to business reputation
impairment, these banking organizations elected to absorb the losses directly.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review of internal controls and policies and procedures will continue
to be an integral part of the examination program.  Greater attention to
management competence and accountability, to management's review of risks
associated with the introduction of new products and services and to its overall
risk awareness will constitute other significant facets of the examination.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This emphasis on risk assessment and control parallels the guidelines
and procedures pertaining to state member bank examinations and bank holding
company inspections that are contained in SR 95-51, and recognizes the efforts of
many progressive institutions in establishing fiduciary risk assessment and control
initiatives of their own.  Along these lines, when rating the quality of risk
management of fiduciary activities, examiners should place primary consideration
on findings relating to the following elements of a sound risk management system:
(1) active board and senior management oversight, (2) adequate policies,
procedures, and limits, (3) adequate risk measurement, monitoring and
management information systems, and (4) comprehensive internal controls.  Each
of these elements is described further below, along with a list of considerations
relevant to assessing the adequacy of each element.<br>
<p>
<p>
<b>Active Board and Management Oversight</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that boards of directors have ultimate responsibility for all of the
activities of their institutions, they should approve overall fiduciary business
strategies and policies including those related to identifying, measuring, monitoring
and controlling fiduciary risks.  The boards of directors must understand the nature
of the risks significant to their organization and ensure that management is taking
the steps necessary to manage these risks. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior management has the responsibility for implementing approved
strategies in a way that will limit fiduciary risks and ensure compliance with laws
and regulations.  Senior management should, therefore, be fully involved in the
fiduciary activities of their institution and have sufficient knowledge of all fiduciary
business lines to ensure that necessary policies, controls and risk monitoring
systems are in place and that accountability and lines of authority are clearly set
forth.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the quality of fiduciary oversight by boards of directors
and senior management, examiners should consider whether these conditions exist:<br>
<p>
<ul><ul>
The board and senior management have a clear understanding and working
knowledge of the types of fiduciary activities performed by the institution
and the risks inherent in them. They have approved appropriate policies,
procedures, recordkeeping systems and reporting systems to support the
fiduciary activities and to help measure and monitor risks.  They have
established procedures to keep them informed about changes in fiduciary
activities and the associated risks. <br>
<p>
Management at all levels provides adequate supervision of the daily activities
of officers and employees to ensure that its lines of fiduciary business are
managed and staffed by persons with knowledge, experience, and expertise
consistent with the nature and scope of the organization's fiduciary
activities. <br>
<p>
Before offering new services or introducing new products, management
identifies the fiduciary risks associated with them and ensures that internal
controls are in place to manage the service or product and the accompanying
risk. <br>
</ul></ul>
<p>
<br>
<b>Adequate Policies, Procedures and Limits</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An institution's directors and senior management should establish
fiduciary and fiduciary risk management policies and procedures commensurate
with the types of activities the institution conducts.  The policies and procedures
should provide enough detailed guidance to ensure that all material areas of
fiduciary activity and risk are addressed.  They should also be modified when
necessary to respond to changes in the organization's activities.  A smaller, less
complex institution that has effective management which is heavily involved in
daily operations generally would be expected to have more basic policies
addressing the significant areas of its activities and setting forth a limited but
appropriate set of requirements and procedures.  In a larger institution, where
senior management must rely on a widely-dispersed staff to implement strategies in
a wide range of complex situations, far more detailed policies and related
procedures would be expected.  <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the adequacy of an institution's fiduciary and fiduciary
risk management policies and procedures, examiners should consider whether these
conditions exist:   <br>
<p>
<ul><ul>
The institution's policies and procedures adequately address the fiduciary
activities performed and are consistent with management's experience level
and the institution's stated goals and objectives. <br>
<p>
The institution's policies and procedures provide for adequate identification,
measurement, monitoring and control of the risks posed by its fiduciary
activities. <br>
<p>
Policies clearly establish accountability and set forth lines of authority.  <br>
<p>
Policies provide for review of new fiduciary services and activities to ensure
that they are suitable and consistent with fiduciary customer objectives, and
that the systems necessary to identify, measure, monitor and control risks
associated with new services and activities are in place before the activity is
initiated. <br>
</ul></ul>
<p>
<b>Adequate Risk Monitoring and Management Information Systems</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk monitoring requires institutions to identify and measure all areas
of material fiduciary risk on a continuous basis.  To do so effectively, risk
monitoring activities must be supported by information systems that provide senior
management with timely reports on financial condition, operating performance,
marketing efforts, new products and services, pending or threatened litigation and
risk exposure arising from fiduciary activities.  They also must provide regular and
more detailed reports for managers engaged in the daily management of the
institution's activities.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sophistication of risk monitoring and control information systems
should be commensurate with the complexity of the institution's fiduciary
operations.  Less complex institutions may require only a limited number of
management reports to support risk monitoring activities.  Larger, more complex
institutions, however, would be expected to have much more comprehensive
reporting and monitoring systems.  These systems would allow for more frequent
reporting and closer monitoring of complex activities.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the adequacy of an institution's measurement and
monitoring of fiduciary risk, examiners should consider whether these conditions
exist:<br>
<p>
<ul><ul>
The institution's fiduciary risk monitoring practices and reports encompass all
of its business lines and activities, and are structured to monitor exposures
consistent with established goals, limits and objectives. <br>
<p>
Key assumptions, data sources, and procedures used in identifying,
measuring and monitoring fiduciary risk are appropriate for the activities
performed by the institution and are adequately documented and tested for
reliability on a continuous basis. <br>
<p>
Reports to management are accurate and timely and contain sufficient
information for policy and decision makers to identity any adverse trends and
any potential or real problems.  The reports must be adequate for them to
evaluate the level of fiduciary risk faced by the institution. <br>
</ul></ul>
<p>
<p>
<b>Adequate Internal Controls</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive internal control structure is critical to the safe and
sound functioning of an institution and its fiduciary risk management system.
Establishing and maintaining a system of internal controls that sets forth official
lines of authority and appropriate segregation of duties is one of management's
most important responsibilities.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A well structured system of internal controls promotes effective
fiduciary operations and reliable reporting, safeguards assets, and helps to ensure
compliance with laws, regulations, and institutional policies.  Controls should be
periodically tested by an independent party (preferably the auditor, or at least an
individual not involved in the process being reviewed) who reports directly to either
the institution's board of directors or one of its designated committees.  Given the
importance of appropriate internal controls to organizations of all sizes and risk
profiles, the results of these reviews should be adequately documented, as should
management's responses to them. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In evaluating the adequacy of an institution's internal controls as they
relate to fiduciary activities, examiners should consider whether these conditions
exist:<br>
<p>
<ul><ul>
The system of internal controls is appropriate to the type and level of
fiduciary activities. <br>
<p>
The institution's organizational structure establishes clear lines of authority
and responsibility. <br>
<p>
Reporting lines provide sufficient independence of the control areas from the
business lines and adequate separation of duties throughout the institution. <br>
<p>
Financial, operational, and regulatory reports are reliable, accurate, and
timely. <br>
<p>
Adequate procedures exist for ensuring compliance with laws and
regulations. <br>
<p>
Internal audit or other control review practices provide for independence and
objectivity. <br>
<p>
Internal controls and information systems are adequately tested and
reviewed with findings documented and weaknesses given appropriate and
timely attention. <br>
<p>
The board of directors and/or the audit committee reviews the effectiveness
of internal audits and other control review activities on a regular basis. <br>
</ul></ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiduciary risk assessment and control categories and tools listed
above are not meant to be all inclusive but are guidelines for use by the fiduciary
examiner and the fiduciary activities management in their risk assessment and
control efforts.  It is expected that adjustments to the list will be made as the risk-
oriented examination approach continues to develop and be utilized.  It is also
expected that the examination of each individual institution may require some
modification depending upon its organization and the complexity of the products
and services offered.<br>
<p>
<br>
<b>Other Initiatives</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Task Force is also reviewing fiduciary examination frequency
guidelines to see if they need to be modified.  In addition, the trust examination
handbook will be changed as necessary to reflect the risk-focused examination
approach.<br>

Consistent with the intent of SR 94-31, which provides state member banks the opportunity to have their fiduciary activities examined on a coordinated basis with the safety and soundness examination of the bank, the proposed increased use of a variety of examiners with various specializations during complex fiduciary examinations is meant to enhance the overall examination process.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref1">Return to text</a>
<p>
<a name="Footnote2">2.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This initiative is also consistent with guidance previously provided to examiners that was contained in SR 93-69 (Examining Risk Management and Internal Controls for Trading Activities of Banking Organizations), SR 94-53 (Investment Adviser Activities), SR 95-17 (Evaluating the Risk Management and Internal Controls of Securities and Derivatives Contracts Used in Nontrading Activities) and SR 95-22 dealing with ratings for U.S. offices of foreign banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref2">Return to text</a>

<p>
<a name="Footnote5">5.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Consistent with SR 95-51, the assignment of a specific risk management rating of from 1 to 5 should be included on the Examiner's Comments page of the confidential section when using the trust examination report.  Comments, conclusions and criticisms relating to risk management should be brought to the attention of management and should be presented in the open section on the &quot;Supervision and Organization&quot; page and, if warranted, on the open section Examiner's Comments page.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In those cases where the findings pertaining to fiduciary activities are integrated into a safety and soundness examination or inspection report of a state member bank, bank holding company or U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank, the risk management comments and rating for fiduciary activities should be included on the respective open and closed section pages that pertain to fiduciary activities and should also be considered and referenced when presenting the comparable subject matter for the overall organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref5">Return to text</a>
