<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Interagency Advisory on the Unsafe and 
   Unsound Use of Limitation of Liability Provisions in External Audit Engagement 
   Letters</div>
<p>The Federal Reserve and the other financial institutions regulatory agencies 
   published on February&nbsp;9,&nbsp;2006, the attached Advisory to address 
   safety and soundness concerns that may arise when financial institutions enter 
   into external audit contracts (typically referred to as &quot;engagement letters&quot;) 
   that limit the auditors' liability for audit services. The Advisory informs 
   financial institutions that it is unsafe and unsound to enter into engagement 
   letters for audits of financial statements, audits of internal control over 
   financial reporting, or attestations on management's assessment of internal 
   control over financial reporting which include provisions that (1)&nbsp;indemnify 
   the external auditor against all claims made by third parties, (2)&nbsp;hold 
   harmless or release the external auditor from liability for claims or potential 
   claims that might be asserted by the client financial institution (other than 
   claims for punitive damages), or (3)&nbsp;limit the remedies available to 
   the client financial institution (other than punitive damages). </p>
<p>The Advisory is effective for audit engagement letters executed on or after 
   February&nbsp;9,&nbsp;2006. The Advisory does not apply to previously executed 
   engagement letters. However, the agencies encourage any financial institution 
   subject to a multi-year audit engagement letter containing unsafe and unsound 
   limitation of liability provisions to seek to amend its engagement letter 
   to be consistent with the Advisory for periods ending in 2007 or later.</p>
<p>This letter and the attached guidance should be distributed to state member 
   banks, bank holding companies, and foreign banking organizations supervised 
   by the Federal Reserve as well as to supervisory and examination staff. Questions 
   pertaining to this letter should be addressed to Terrill&nbsp;Garrison, Supervisory 
   Financial Analyst, (202)&nbsp;452-2712 or Nina&nbsp;Nichols, Assistant Director, 
   (202)&nbsp;452-2961.</p>
