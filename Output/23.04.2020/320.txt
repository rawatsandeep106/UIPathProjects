&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter implements changes to guidance for preparing the Bank Holding
Company Inspection and Bank Examination Reports and in the requirements for the
issuance of Director's Summaries of Examination and Inspection Findings.&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes,
which are effective immediately, are the outgrowth of work done by the Task Force of the
Supervision Efficiency Enhancement Project.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guidance on the preparation of the Bank Holding Company Inspection Report
(and of certain pages of the Bank Examination Report) is changed as follows:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The inspection report that is sent to a bank holding company,
henceforth, will be composed of a Core Section and an Appendix
Section.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Core Section is to provide a clear and concise discussion
of the conclusions and recommendations of the examiner.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Appendix Section must include financial statements for the
organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, examiners have the discretion to complete
any of the remaining standard report pages and insert selected pages in
either the Core Section or the Appendix Section, depending on the
circumstances of each inspection.&nbsp;&nbsp;The part of the inspection report
prepared for the Federal Reserve's internal use remains unchanged in
format and content (confidential report pages A through D). <br>
<p>
<li>There will no longer be different report formats for large and small bank
holding companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners may use their  discretion as described
above to structure reports to fit the circumstances of any inspected
company, large or small. <br>
<p>
<li>The page previously entitled &quot;Examiner's Comments&quot; is now entitled
&quot;Examiner's Comments and Matters Requiring Special Board Attention.&quot;
This page should be used to present all assessments and conclusions
that are significant and specify matters that require the attention of the
bank holding company's board of directors.&nbsp;&nbsp;This page should be
written so that it may, with minor modification, also serve as the full
text for the Summary of Inspection Findings presented to the board of
directors of the holding company should that prove necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
In parallel fashion, the two pages of the standard interagency Bank
Examination Report entitled &quot;Examination Conclusions and Comments&quot; and
&quot;Matters Requiring Board Attention&quot; should be prepared so that they are not
duplicative and may easily be integrated should the issuance of a Summary
Report to the board of directors of the bank prove necessary. <br>
<p>
<li>Henceforth, financial write-ups will only be required for bank
subsidiaries that hold ten percent or more of a bank holding company's
consolidated assets and for any bank subsidiary evidencing material
financial deficiencies or other characteristics that should be brought to
the attention of the bank holding company's board of directors<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></a>. <br>
<p>
<li>Company-prepared financial statements may be used instead of
standardized Federal Reserve financial statement report pages, if, in the
judgment of the examiner, they are suitably detailed, clear, and
accurate. <br>
<p>
<li>A new page entitled &quot;Treasury Activities / Capital Markets&quot; must be included in inspection reports prepared for Bank
Holding Companies that have significant exposure in the capital markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;At
the conclusion of a six-month field testing period, Reserve Banks should
forward to Board staff designated below any recommended changes as to
the page's format and use.&nbsp;&nbsp;Field testing can commence immediately. <br>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guidance on the issuance to members of the boards of directors of troubled
banks and bank holding companies of Summaries of Examination and Inspection Findings is
changed as follows:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>As noted above, the text of the &quot;Examiner's Comments and Matters Requiring
Special Board Attention&quot; page will be prepared so that it can be used to serve as
the full text for the Director's Summary of Inspection Findings with only minor
formatting changes. <br>
<p>
The standard interagency Bank Examination Report specifies separate pages
for &quot;Matters Requiring Board Attention&quot; and &quot;Examination Conclusions and
Comments.&quot;  Nonetheless, these pages should be prepared so that they are
not duplicative and may be easily integrated should it prove necessary to
issue a Director's Summary of Examination Findings. <br>
<p>
<li>SR 85-28 is amended to specify that Director's Summaries need not be issued to
board members of organizations assigned BOPEC composite ratings of 3 or 4 in
cases in which such Summaries were issued at the conclusion of a prior
inspection or examination and the organization has been taking appropriate steps
to correct identified deficiencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examiners, of course, in these as in all other
cases, may decide to issue Summaries to board members when they deem that
that will prove constructive in resolving potential or actual problems of the
company. <br>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes should also be adopted where appropriate in preparing a
combined Commercial Bank Examination and Bank Holding Company Inspection Report.
The guidance set forth in SR 94-46 is amended to incorporate this change in instruction.<br>
<p>
<b>Revisions to Guidance for Preparation of the Bank Holding Company Inspection Report (and
of Certain Pages of the Bank Examination Report)</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revisions in the Bank Holding Company Inspection Report have been
made to facilitate the preparation of a more streamlined report, one that provides boards of
directors and management with clearly and concisely stated presentations of examiner's
significant findings and recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp;To that end, examiners are required only to
include in the Core Section a relatively small number of report pages and, in the Appendix
Section, only financial statements for the organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, examiners are
given the discretion to decide whether to include other standard pages in a report and
whether that inclusion should be either in the Core or the Appendix Section.&nbsp;&nbsp;This choice
should be made on the basis of whether the content of the page will highlight a significant
finding of the inspection (in which case it should be included in the Core Section) or will
provide support for comments being offered in the Core Section (in which case it should
ordinarily be placed in the Appendix ection).&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the discretion being accorded
examiners to tailor reports to convey accurately inspection findings, reports prepared for
large and small companies alike should be prepared to achieve that objective, and there is
no longer a need to have different standard report formats for companies of different sizes. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important objective of this reformatting is to avoid excessive length in the
report, particularly in the open section,  that can result from the inclusion of comments
that may provide directors and management with information of marginal importance or
from repetition of findings and conclusions on different pages of the report<a href="#Footnote2" title="Footnote 2" name="Footref2"><SUP>2</SUP></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition,
the objective is to produce an understandable and readable report.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to
reemphasize that achievement of that objective will require, in addition to the reformatting
of the report, that examiners determine precisely what should be conveyed to boards of
directors and management in their reports and then present that information in clear and
concise language.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhibit 1 presents a listing of the standard pages of the reformatted report.
As can be seen, there are but six pages listed as mandatory for the Core Section, three of
those being the Report Cover, the Table of Contents, and the Scope and Abbreviations
page.&nbsp;&nbsp;The page entitled &quot;Examiner's Comments and Matters Requiring Special Board
Attention,&quot; which is to follow the Table of Contents page, is to provide a clear, succinct,
and self-contained discussion of the examiner's significant findings, conclusions, and
recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be prepared so that it fulfills requirements specified for
Director's Summaries of Inspection Findings in SR 85-28 and can also serve as the full text
of the Director's Summary, if such a summary is to be provided to the company's board of
directors.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Analysis of Financial Factors is also required and has long been included in
the Core Section of inspection reports for obvious reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Audit Program
page is required.&nbsp;&nbsp;This page has been included in the core to emphasize the importance
assigned to the maintenance by bank holding companies of comprehensive and effective
internal controls.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A required Appendix Section is to contain comparative balance sheet and
income statements for the parent company and for the consolidated organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;These
pages may be prepared by examiners in accordance with past requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively,
these required pages may be financial statements prepared by the company, if, in the
judgment of the examiner, they are suitably detailed, clear, and accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the company-prepared financial statements meet that criteria, examiners are encouraged to use them, in
part, because that will enable the examiner to avoid the tedious work of transcribing
numbers to a financial statement page.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, company-prepared statements, if
acceptable to the examiner, are to be preferred, because they are in a form that the
company has selected for its use and with which its board of directors is familiar.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As summarized earlier, the pages listed as optional are to be selected by the
examiner for inclusion in the report when that will enable the examiner to convey
significant findings in the Core Section or to support the discussion in the Core Section
with an Appendix page.&nbsp;&nbsp;This list contains some pages that previous guidance required be
included in the Core Section, as well as pages that previously were designated as optional
Supporting Report Pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a new page, entitled &quot;Treasury Activities/Capital
Markets&quot; has been added to this list to respond to the growing importance of capital and
derivative market activities for many banking organizations<a href="#Footnote3" title="Footnote 3" name="Footref3"><SUP>3</SUP></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;(As noted above, this page--the contents of which are detailed in exhibit 2--should be field tested for six months at
organizations at which such activities are significant.)  This page should be placed either in
the Core Section or the Appendix Section, depending on the importance of the activity to
the organization and the examiners's discussion objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;The report page poses
questions that the examiner should respond to when completing this page.&nbsp;&nbsp;The System's
Trading Activities Manual and sections 2125.0 and 2128.0 of the Bank Holding Company
Supervision Manual  provide guidance for answering the questions presented on the report
page (see also SR 93-69 and SR 94-45).&nbsp;&nbsp; At the conclusion of the field testing period,
Reserve Banks should forward any comments on the page to Kevin Bertsch at Mail Stop
174.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the revisions discussed above are designed to sharply focus the
inspection report on matters that require board attention and to reduce the work burden on
examiners.&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of optional pages, for instance, permits the presentation of all
information that the examiner believes should be brought to the attention of the board of
directors and management in a clear and non-repetitive way.&nbsp;&nbsp;The determination that write-ups of individual bank subsidiaries can be limited to those bank subsidiaries that hold over
ten percent of a company's total consolidated assets and/or to those bank subsidiaries that
have significant problems also fosters the objective of presenting only relevant information.
In addition, limiting the write-up requirement in this way will reduce the work burden on
examiners without affecting the overall risk assessment presentation in the inspection
report.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<p>
<b>Director's Summaries of Examination/Inspection Findings</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Director's Summary Report on Inspection Findings, it is
believed that using the text of the &quot;Examiner's Comments and Matters Requiring Special
Board Attention&quot; page for this Summary Report will reduce the work of examiners without
impairing the quality of the report.&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar reduction in work burden should also be
achieved in the case of Director's Summaries of Examination Findings when the two pages
of the standard interagency Bank Examination Report entitled &quot;Examination Conclusions
and Comments&quot; and &quot;Matters Requiring Board Attention&quot; are prepared so that they are not
duplicative and may be easily integrated should the issuance of a Summary prove
necessary.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision not to require the issuance of a Director's Summary Report
when a 3- or 4-rated bank holding company or state member bank has previously received
such a report and has been responding to a Reserve Bank's directives (and possibly to
informal or formal enforcement actions) is based on the view that the Director's Summary
should be reserved for situations in which it is most effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, these
Director's Summaries should be issued when a bank holding company or state member
bank is assigned a composite rating of 5 and in other cases when there is a need to (a)
underscore the gravity of a situation, or (b) to enlist an appropriate response by directors,
or both.&nbsp;&nbsp;   <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your reference, several sections of the Bank Holding Company
Supervision Manual have been revised to incorporate these changes and are attached.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
revised sections, and other related editorial adjustments, will be included in the printed
June 1995 revision supplement.<br>
<p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions regarding these revisions should be directed to Harry Moore at
(202/452-3493) or Kevin Bertsch at (202/452-5265).<br>
