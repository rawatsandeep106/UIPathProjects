<b>BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM<br>

<hr>
<p>
<br>
<center><b>JOINT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE INTERAGENCY STATEMENT<br>
ON RETAIL SALES OF NONDEPOSIT INVESTMENT PRODUCTS</b></center><br>
<p>
<br>
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Office of Thrift Supervision
(OTS), the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC) (banking agencies) have collectively responded to an American Bankers Association
(ABA) letter regarding the application of the Interagency Statement on Retail Sales of
Nondeposit Investment Products (the Interagency Statement) issued February 15, 1994.&nbsp;&nbsp;A
copy of the banking agencies' response is attached.<br>
<p>
The banking agencies are also taking this opportunity to communicate our position regarding
abbreviated disclosures and to clarify certain instances where we believe that it is not
necessary to provide the disclosures outlined in the Interagency Statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of
abbreviated disclosure under the circumstances described offers an optional alternative to the
longer disclosures prescribed by the Interagency Statement.<br>
<p>
<b>RESPONSE TO THE ABA</b><br>
<p>
As more fully explained in the attached letter, the banking agencies' response to the ABA
addresses the following:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Retail sales include (but are not limited to) sales to individuals by depository
institution personnel or third party personnel conducted in or adjacent to a depository
institution's lobby area. <br>
<p>
<li>Sales of government and municipal securities made in a depository institution's dealer
department located away from the lobby area are not subject to the Interagency
Statement. <br>
<p>
<li>The Interagency Statement generally does not apply to fiduciary accounts administered
by a depository institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for fiduciary accounts where the customer
directs investments, such as self-directed individual retirement accounts, the
disclosures prescribed by the Interagency Statement should be provided. <br>
<p>
<li>The Interagency Statement applies to affiliated broker dealers when the sales occur on
the premises of the depository institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statement also applies to sales
activities of an affiliated broker dealer resulting from a referral of retail customers by
the depository institution. <br>
</ul>
<p>
<b>DISCLOSURE MATTERS</b><br>
<p>
The banking agencies would like to address several disclosure matters with respect to the
Interagency Statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the agencies agree there are limited situations in which
the disclosure guidelines need not apply or where a shorter logo format may be used in lieu
of the longer written disclosures called for by the Interagency Statement.<br>
<p>
The Interagency Statement disclosures do not need to be provided in the following situations: <br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>radio broadcasts of 30 seconds or less; <br>
<p>
<li>electronic signs<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></a>, and <br>
<p>
<li>signs, such as banners and posters, when used only as location indicators. <br>
</ul>
<p>
Additionally, third party vendors not affiliated with the depository institution need not make
the Interagency Statement disclosures on nondeposit investment product confirmations and
in account statements that may incidentally, with a valid business purpose, contain the name
of the depository institution. <br>
<p>
The banking agencies have been asked whether shorter, logo format disclosures may be used
in visual media, such as television broadcasts, ATM screens, billboards, signs, posters, and
in written advertisements and promotional materials, such as brochures.&nbsp;&nbsp;The text of an
acceptable logo format disclosure would include the following statements: <br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Not FDIC Insured<br>
<li>No Bank Guarantee<br>
<li>May Lose Value<br>
</ul>
<p>
The logo format disclosures would be boxed, set in bold face type, and displayed in a
conspicuous manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;The full disclosures prescribed by the Interagency Statement should
continue to be provided in written acknowledgement forms that are signed by customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;An
example of an acceptable logo disclosure is: <br>

<p>
Dear Ms. Miller:<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in response to your letters to the staffs of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (banking agencies) seeking clarification of the application of the
February 15, 1994, Interagency Statement on Retail Sales of Nondeposit Investment Products.
To promote uniformity in the supervision of these activities, the agencies along with the
Office of Thrift Supervision (banking agencies) are providing this joint response.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Interagency Statement was issued to address the expansion by depository
institutions of activities involving the recommendation and sale to retail customers of
nondeposit investment products, including mutual funds and annuities as well as stocks and
other investment products. The Statement focuses on issues that pertain specifically to the
retail sale of investment products to customers on depository institution premises, and seeks
to avoid customer confusion of such products with those that are FDIC insured primarily
through disclosure and separation of sales of investment products from other banking
activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Statement provides guidance to depository institutions with respect
to sales practices that are consistent with those applicable to registered securities brokers and
dealers.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You suggest that the application of the Statement be limited to &quot;bank retail
sales of mutual funds and annuities.&quot;  If this approach is not accepted by the banking
agencies, you suggest that the Statement should not apply to sales of nondeposit investment
products by a depository institution's government and municipal securities dealer departments,
to a trust department or to an affiliated trust company, to custodial accounts, or to a bank-affiliated stand alone brokerage operation.<br>
<p>
<b>Limitation to Sales of Mutual Funds and Annuities</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some depository institutions limit their sales of nondeposit investment
products to mutual funds and annuities, others advertise and offer a fuller range of securities
brokerage or financial advisory services to retail customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The banking agencies are
concerned that conducting these activities on bank premises also could engender customer
confusion and raise concerns about safe and sound banking practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, it would not be
appropriate to limit the application of the Statement to mutual funds and annuities as you
requested.<br>
<p>
<b>Sales From Lobby Area Presumed Retail</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banking agencies agree with your assessment that retail sales include (but
are not limited to) sales to individuals by depository institution personnel or third party
personnel conducted in or adjacent to, a depository institution's lobby area.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales activities
occurring in another location of a depository institution may also be retail sales activities
covered by the Interagency Statement depending on the facts and circumstances.<br>
<p>
<b>Government or Municipal Securities Dealers or Desks</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales of government and municipal securities made from a depository
institution's dealer department away from the lobby area would not be subject to the
Interagency Statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such departments already are regulated by the banking agencies and
are subject to the statutory requirements for registration of government and municipal
securities brokers and dealers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, such brokers and dealers are subject to sales practice
and other regulations of the Department of the Treasury or the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and of designated securities self regulatory organizations.<br>
<p>
<b>Fiduciary Accounts, Affiliated Trust Companies and Custodian Accounts</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the banking agencies agree with your view that the Interagency
Statement does not apply to fiduciary accounts administered by a depository institution.
However, the disclosures prescribed by the Interagency Statement should be provided to non-institutional customers who direct investments for their fiduciary accounts, such as self
directed individual retirement accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, disclosures need not be made to
customers acting as professional money managers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiduciary accounts administered by an
affiliated trust company on the depository institution's premises would be treated the same
way as the fiduciary accounts of the institution. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to custodian accounts maintained by a depository institution, the
Interagency Statement does not apply to the activities described in your letter, e.g., collecting
interest and dividend payments for securities held in the accounts and handling the delivery or
collection of securities or funds in connection with a transaction.<br>
<p>
<b>Affiliated Stand Alone Broker Dealers</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, you ask how the Interagency Statement applies to bank affiliated stand
alone broker dealers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statement applies specifically to sales of nondeposit investment <br>
products on the premises of a depository institution, e.g., whenever sales occur in the lobby
area.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statement also applies to sales activities of an affiliated broker dealer resulting
from a referral of retail customers by the depository institution to the broker dealer.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We appreciate the views of the ABA in helping to clarify the scope of the
Interagency Statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that this letter will provide additional guidance to the
industry in complying with the Statement in a safe and sound manner consistent with
principles of customer protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
<center>Sincerely,</center><br>
