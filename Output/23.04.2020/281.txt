&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A practice unique to the brokered foreign exchange
market is the use of &quot;Points&quot; as a way to settle disputed
contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Points&quot; are used in the brokered foreign exchange
market as a means of dealing with problems arising from missed
prices, from miscommunications, and/or from broker and dealer
errors.&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of &quot;points&quot; permits a disputed brokered
transaction to be completed but defers settlement of the
difference arising from  it (measured in &quot;Points&quot;) until these
&quot;points&quot; are settled by - depending on the circumstances -
arranging proportionately advantageous or disadvantageous future
trades or by explicit payment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since &quot;Points&quot; are an informal
accommodation between individual traders and brokers they are not
normally included in the financial records of the institution on
whose behalf the foreign exchange contract was completed and are
often accomplished without formal management acknowledgment.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ineffective policies, procedures and controls over
disputed contracts by a financial institution can result in
inaccurate records, misleading reports filed with regulatory and
tax authorities, misapplication of funds, and potential violation
of the institution's internal policies and federal criminal laws
regarding gifts to bank personnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. bank regulatory
agencies have found that the use of &quot;Points&quot; is a practice that
can lead to significant abuse and is considered an unsafe and
unsound banking practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, each U.S. commercial bank,
Edge or Agreement corporation, and branch, agency and commercial
lending company associated with a foreign bank, subject to U.S.
federal bank regulatory agencies' supervisory jurisdiction that
deals in foreign exchange must develop, adopt, and implement
detailed policies and procedures regarding disputed contracts. 
The written policy should detail the financial institution's
approach to resolving disputed trades and should prohibit the use
of points.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate procedures should be developed that identify
and control risk, and at a minimum should detail proper
accounting, management and financial controls over disputed
contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy statement should be approved by senior
management and reviewed by the board of directors in the case of a
bank or the parent institution in the case of an office of a
foreign bank or Edge corporation.
