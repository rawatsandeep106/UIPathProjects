<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Interagency Guidance on Sharing Suspicious 
   Activity Reports with Head Offices and Controlling Companies </div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network&nbsp;(FinCEN), 
   along with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit 
   Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Office 
   of Thrift Supervision, has issued the attached interagency guidance for banking 
   organizations on sharing Suspicious Activity Reports with head offices and 
   controlling companies (as defined in the guidance). The guidance confirms 
   that:&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank may disclose 
   a Suspicious Activity Report to its head office outside the United States; 
   and (2)&nbsp;a U.S. depository institution may disclose a Suspicious Activity 
   Report to controlling companies whether domestic or foreign. The guidance 
   notes that banking organizations should maintain appropriate arrangements 
   for the protection of confidentiality of Suspicious Activity Reports.</p>
<p>The guidance does not address whether a banking organization may share a Suspicious 
   Activity Report with an affiliate other than a controlling company or head 
   office, whether located inside the United&nbsp;States or abroad. Until further 
   guidance is issued, banking organizations should not share Suspicious Activity 
   Reports with such affiliates. </p>
<p>FinCEN has concurrently issued similar guidance (also attached) for securities 
   broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, and introducing brokers in commodities. 
</p>
<p>This SR letter should be distributed to the appropriate management and compliance 
   personnel at the domestic and foreign banking organizations supervised by 
   the Federal Reserve, and Reserve Banks should distribute this SR&nbsp;letter 
   to supervisory and examination staff. If you have any questions, please contact 
   Nina&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Nichols, Assistant Director, at (202)&nbsp;452-2961, or 
   Bridget&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Neill, Assistant Director, at (202)&nbsp;452-5235.</p>
