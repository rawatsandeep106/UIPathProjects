   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The Federal Reserve has revised its reporting requirements with 
   respect to foreign investments made by U.S. banking organizations 
   pursuant to Subpart&nbsp;A of Regulation&nbsp;K.&nbsp; The Federal 
   Reserve has replaced the FR&nbsp;2064 report with the new 
   FR&nbsp;Y-10, Report of Changes in Organizational Structure, and 
   with new internal recordkeeping requirements for internationally 
   active domestic banking organizations.&nbsp; The purpose of this 
   letter is to provide guidance to both examiners and banking 
   organizations regarding the new reporting requirements.&nbsp; In 
   particular, this letter provides guidance to examiners on what 
   should be reviewed during on-site examinations of internationally 
   active domestic banking organizations.&nbsp; It also provides 
   guidance on internal recordkeeping that is expected from domestic 
   banking organizations going forward.</P>

<P><B>Background</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Effective&nbsp;September&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2001, the Federal Reserve 
   eliminated the collection of the FR&nbsp;2064 report.&nbsp; This 
   report historically was used by the Board to monitor international 
   investments made by U.S. banking organizations and to fulfill the 
   Board's supervisory responsibilities pursuant to 
   Sections&nbsp;211.8&nbsp;-&nbsp;211.10 of Regulation&nbsp;K (as 
   per the final rule implementing Regulation&nbsp;K published in 
   the <I>Federal Register</I> on October&nbsp;26,&nbsp;2001, and 
   effective on November&nbsp;26,&nbsp;2001).<A HREF="#Footnote1" 
   name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>&nbsp; The FR&nbsp;2064 report 
   was the Federal Reserve's primary tool to monitor compliance with 
   relevant sections of the Federal Reserve&nbsp;Act and 
   Regulation&nbsp;K, including the general consent provisions of 
   Regulation&nbsp;K.<A HREF="#Footnote2" 
   name="Footref2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>&nbsp; The report collected 
   information on changes in international investments made by 
   member banks, Edge and agreement corporations, and bank holding 
   companies.&nbsp; The report also was the only source of cost 
   information for the Board regarding investments made under the 
   general consent provisions of Regulation&nbsp;K.&nbsp; In 1995, 
   the general consent authority was significantly expanded.&nbsp; 
   As a consequence, greater importance was placed on monitoring 
   the level of international investments in order to ensure 
   compliance with relevant banking laws and regulations, and to 
   ensure that banking organizations do not expose themselves to 
   undue risk.&nbsp; In October&nbsp;2001, the Board approved 
   significant additional liberalizations in the Regulation&nbsp;K 
   general consent authority, further increasing the importance of 
   monitoring international investments.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Although the FR&nbsp;2064 report has been eliminated, examiners 
   have a continuing need to monitor compliance with the Federal 
   Reserve&nbsp;Act and Sections&nbsp;211.8&nbsp;-&nbsp;211.10 of 
   the revised Regulation&nbsp;K.&nbsp; Information previously 
   collected in the FR&nbsp;2064 report is now being collected 
   partly through the new FR&nbsp;Y-10 and the FR&nbsp;Y-6 reports, 
   and partly through a requirement that banking organizations 
   maintain records of comparable information.&nbsp; Within 
   30&nbsp;days of the transaction, banking organizations are 
   required to report changes in investments (both foreign and 
   domestic) on the FR&nbsp;Y-10 report.&nbsp; Investments of 
   less than 25&nbsp;percent of the voting shares of a foreign 
   nonbanking company are not captured by the new FR&nbsp;Y-10 
   report.<A HREF="#Footnote3" name="Footref3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>&nbsp; 
   However, on an annual basis using the FR&nbsp;Y-6 report, banking 
   organizations are required to report all investments, including 
   those between 5&nbsp;and 25&nbsp;percent of voting shares.<A 
   HREF="#Footnote4" name="Footref4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>&nbsp; 
   Structure and geographical information relating to foreign 
   investments is now reported on the FR&nbsp;Y-10 and FR&nbsp;Y-6 
   for ongoing monitoring.&nbsp; During the examination process, 
   examiners are expected to review investment amounts and 
   activities.</P>

<P><B>Examiner Guidance</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Generally, the portion of the examination dealing with 
   Regulation&nbsp;K compliance should focus on confirming that 
   investments made pursuant to the general consent provisions meet 
   the restrictions on investment amount and activities contained in 
   Sections&nbsp;211.8&nbsp;-&nbsp;211.10 of Regulation&nbsp;K.&nbsp; 
   Investments made under the general consent provisions of 
   Regulation&nbsp;K can be sizeable and, thus, can pose significant 
   risk to the banking organization.&nbsp; Examiners should keep in 
   mind that the Board has the authority to rescind an organization's 
   general consent investment privileges for various reasons, 
   including safety and soundness concerns and noncompliance with 
   the existing requirements of Regulation&nbsp;K.</P>  

<P><B>Recordkeeping Requirements</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Although the FR&nbsp;2064 report will no longer be collected, 
   internationally active U.S. banking organizations are still 
   expected to maintain adequate internal records to allow examiners 
   to review compliance with the investment provisions of 
   Regulation&nbsp;K.&nbsp; For each investment made under 
   Subpart&nbsp;A of Regulation&nbsp;K, records should be maintained 
   regarding the type of investment, for example, equity (voting 
   shares, nonvoting shares, partnerships, interests conferring 
   ownership rights, participating loans), binding commitments, 
   capital contributions, and subordinated debt; the amount of the 
   investment; the percentage ownership; activities conducted by the 
   company and the legal authority for such activities; and whether 
   the investment was made under general consent, prior notice, or 
   specific consent authority.&nbsp; With respect to investments made 
   under general consent authority, information also must be 
   maintained that demonstrates compliance with the various limits 
   set out in Section&nbsp;211.9 of Regulation&nbsp;K.&nbsp;</P> 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Information maintained by the banking organization should be made 
   available to examination staff during the course of on-site 
   examinations and pursuant to other supervisory requests.&nbsp; At 
   this time, the Federal Reserve is not requiring that such 
   information be maintained in a specific form.&nbsp; Regardless of 
   form, recordkeeping must be adequate to permit examiners to 
   determine compliance.&nbsp; Examiners are expected to review a 
   sample of these investments to determine the accuracy of the 
   organization's records and compliance with the regulation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    The Board has granted its general consent to U.S. banking 
    organizations to make foreign investments without prior notice 
    to the Board if the investment meets certain criteria.&nbsp; 
    The criteria relate to whether the investment is in a subsidiary 
    or a joint venture, or is a portfolio investment, and whether 
    the investor is a bank holding company, a member bank, or an Edge 
    or agreement corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<A

    Regulation&nbsp;K authorizes portfolio investments in less than 
    20&nbsp;percent of the shares of a foreign company regardless of 
    the activities engaged in by that company.  Under the new 
    reporting regime, portfolio investments within the general 
    consent limits will only be required to be reported on an annual 
    basis on the FR&nbsp;Y-6 report.&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
