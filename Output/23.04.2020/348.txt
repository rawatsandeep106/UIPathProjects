&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Purpose and Scope</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The final rule adopting changes to Regulation&nbsp;Y is
designed to reduce unnecessary regulatory burden while at the same time allowing
the System to continue to carry out faithfully its responsibilities under the Bank Holding
Company Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the changes that have been adopted are changes to
Regulation Y<a href="#Footnote1" title="Footnote 1" name="Footref1"><SUP>1</SUP></a> that implement provisions enacted by the Economic Growth and
Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 for notices processed under section&nbsp;4 of
the Bank Holding Company Act (&quot;BHC Act&quot;) (&quot;section&nbsp;4&quot;).&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>See</b> section 225.23 of
Regulation Y (12&nbsp;CFR 225.23).&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, these provisions provide streamlined
procedures for certain nonbanking proposals that are intended to reduce significantly
regulatory burden in the notice review process and to improve the ability of well-run
bank holding companies to respond quickly to changes in the market place.&nbsp;&nbsp;These
changes reflect the philosophy that a well-run bank holding company that meets
objective and verifiable measures for each of the criteria set forth in the BHC Act and
the regulation should be able to expect little burden or delay in the application and/or
notice review process for routine or small proposals unless special circumstances
demonstrate that a closer review is warranted.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the notice process should
focus on an analysis of the effects of the specific proposal and should not become a
vehicle for comprehensively evaluating and addressing supervisory and compliance
issues that can be more effectively addressed in the supervisory process.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the review of a proposal under the streamlined procedures
should focus on whether the qualifying criteria have been met.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the
System is aware, either from information obtained in the review process or from
information otherwise available to the System, that a proposal or a notificant warrants
closer review to assess any potential adverse effect or other matter related to a
statutory factor required to be considered under section 4, the proposal must be processed
under the normal 30/60 day procedures.<a href="#Footnote2" title="Footnote 2" name="Footref2"><SUP>2</SUP></a>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two separate streamlined procedures are available to bank holding
companies that meet the qualifying criteria set forth in the regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;One streamlined
procedure permits a well-run bank holding company to engage <i>de&nbsp;novo</i>, directly or
indirectly, in any nonbanking activity approved by the Board by regulation (as
amended),<a href="#Footnote3" title="Footnote 3" name="Footref3"><SUP>3</SUP></a> if the bank holding company provides notice to the System within
10&nbsp;business days <b>after</b> commencing the nonbanking activity (the &quot;10 day post notice
procedures&quot;).&nbsp;&nbsp;The other streamlined procedure permits a well-run bank holding
company (a) to engage <i>de&nbsp;novo</i> in any nonbanking activity approved by Board order,
or (b) to acquire voting shares or assets of a going concern engaged in any
nonbanking activity approved by Board order or regulation,<a href="#Footnote4" title="Footnote 4" name="Footref4"><SUP>4</SUP></a> if the bank holding
company has provided written notice to the System at least 12 business days prior to
commencing the proposed activity (the &quot;12 day prior notice procedures&quot;), and the
System has not indicated within that period that a notice would be required under the
30/60 day procedures for a section 4 notice.<a href="#Footnote5" title="Footnote 5" name="Footref5"><SUP>5</SUP></a><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streamlined procedures may only be used in connection with
nonbanking proposals by bank holding companies that meet the criteria and other
conditions described in Regulation Y.&nbsp;&nbsp;These procedures are not available for section
4 notices that involve a savings association or other insured depository institutions
(such as a trust company or credit card bank) that are not considered to be a &quot;bank&quot;
under the BHC Act.<a href="#Footnote6" title="Footnote 6" name="Footref6"><SUP>6</SUP></a><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals that require approval under both section 3 and section 4 of the
BHC Act should be processed under the applicable section 3 procedure (<i>i.e.</i> either the
streamlined procedures or the 30/60 day procedures).&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reserve Bank should
notify the applicant in writing immediately after receipt of the application that the
section&nbsp;4 portion of the proposal will be processed under the section 3 procedures,
and should describe the nonbanking companies to be acquired in the <i>Federal&nbsp;Register</i>
notice. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter explains the requirements of the streamlined procedures, the
criteria that should be reviewed, and the information that must be provided by the
notificant.&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter also provides guidance for resolving various issues that may
arise under the streamlined procedures.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be successful in reducing regulatory burden under the new
procedures, Reserve Bank and Board staffs should make every effort to determine as
early as possible whether a proposal qualifies for the streamlined procedure, and
whether an issue is raised that may warrant a more in-depth review of the proposal or
the institutions involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;The streamlined procedures clearly contemplate that any
proposal that meets the qualifying criteria may nevertheless be processed under the
30/60 procedures if issues are raised.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential, however, that such issues be
identified early, and that, once identified, the proposal be quickly transferred to the
30/60 day procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserve Bank staff is urged to discuss potential issues and
procedural questions with Board staff at the outset in reviewing cases under the
streamlined procedures so that a prompt determination may be made regarding
whether the 30/60 day processing procedures should be used. <br>
<p>
<ol type=I>
<b><li>Criteria for the 10 Day Post Notice and the 12 Day Prior Notice Procedures</b>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both section 4 streamlined procedures are available only if a proposal
clearly meets all of the following criteria.<a href="#Footnote7" title="Footnote 7" name="Footref7"><SUP>7</SUP></a><br>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<b><li>Financial criteria</b> -- The financial criteria must be met by the acquiring
bank holding company before <b>and</b> immediately after the proposed
transaction.<a href="#Footnote8" title="Footnote 8" name="Footref8"><SUP>8</SUP></a>   <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><i>The acquiring bank holding company must be well-capitalized.</i><a href="#Footnote9" title="Footnote 9" name="Footref9"><SUP>9</SUP></a>
<p>
<i>Definition of well-capitalized</i> -- A bank holding company is
well-capitalized for purposes of meeting the qualifying criteria if: <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;On a consolidated basis, the bank holding company
maintains a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0&nbsp;percent or more
and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0&nbsp;percent or more; and <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;The bank holding company is not subject to any written
agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action
directive issued by the Board to meet and maintain a specific
capital level for any capital measure. <br>
<p>
<i>Foreign banking organizations</i> -- The following standards apply for
determining whether a foreign banking organization is
well-capitalized for purposes of meeting the qualifying criteria: <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;If the home country supervisor<a href="#Footnote10" title="Footnote 10" name="Footref10"><SUP>10</SUP></a> of a foreign banking
organization has adopted capital standards consistent in all
respects with the Capital Accord of the Basle Committee on
Banking Supervision (&quot;Basle Accord&quot;), the foreign banking
organization may: <br>
<p>
<ul>
(1) &nbsp;Calculate its capital ratios under the home country
standard; or  <br>
<p>
(2) &nbsp;Calculate the capital ratios indicated above under the
well-capitalized standards applicable to a U.S. banking
organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;A foreign banking organization choosing this
option must apply U.S.&nbsp;capital standards in all respects and
must consult with the Reserve Bank in advance to ensure
that sufficient information is provided in the notice to verify
compliance with U.S. capital standards. <br>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;If the home country supervisor has <b>not</b> adopted capital
standards consistent in all respects with the Basle Accord, the
foreign banking organization is considered well-capitalized only if
the foreign banking organization obtains a determination from the
Board, in advance of filing a notice, that its capital is equivalent to
the capital that would be required for a U.S. banking organization
to be considered well-capitalized.&nbsp;&nbsp;These determinations will be
made on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests by foreign banking
organizations for such determinations should be submitted in
writing to the Director, Division of Banking Supervision and
Regulation. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) &nbsp;The regulation requires the provision of <i>pro&nbsp;forma</i>
financial information and capital ratios based on the most recent
quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless recent <b>existing</b> consolidated capital ratios are
provided by the foreign banking organization or are otherwise
available to the System, the Reserve Bank will need to estimate
the capital ratios of the foreign banking organization by using the
<i>pro&nbsp;forma</i> capital and balance sheet information that is to be
included in the notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these instances, the Reserve Bank
should compare the financial information used in calculating the
capital ratios with the capital ratios reported by the foreign banking
organization in its most recent Y-7 submission and any other more
recent data available to the System.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Reserve Bank believes
that the reported data and the data submitted in the notice may
not accurately reflect the current consolidated capital position of
the foreign banking organization, the Reserve Bank may request
additional information.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the current consolidated capital position
of the foreign banking organization does not appear to meet the
well-capitalized criterion, the notice should be processed under the
30/60 day procedures. <br>
<p>
<i>Small bank holding companies</i> -- A bank holding company that, on
a <i>pro&nbsp;forma</i> basis, will continue to have consolidated assets of
less than $150&nbsp;million and that is subject to the Small Bank
Holding Company Policy Statement in Appendix C of Regulation Y
is well-capitalized for purposes of meeting the qualifying criteria if
it meets the requirements for expedited/waived processing
contained in the Policy Statement. <br>
<p>
<li><i>The lead insured depository institution of the acquiring bank
holding company must be well-capitalized.</i> <br>
<p>
<i>Definition of well-capitalized insured depository institution</i> -- An
insured depository institution is well-capitalized if the institution
maintains at least the capital levels required to be
&quot;well-capitalized&quot; under the capital adequacy regulations or
guidelines applicable to the institution that have been adopted by
the appropriate federal banking agency (&quot;AFBA&quot;) for the
institution.<a href="#Footnote11" title="Footnote 11" name="Footref11"><SUP>11</SUP></a>  Unlike the definition of &quot;well-capitalized&quot; that applies
to a bank holding company, the definition applicable to insured
depository institutions typically includes a leverage component as
well as risk-based capital requirements. <br>
<p>
<i>Definition of lead insured depository institution</i> -- The lead insured
depository institution is the largest insured depository institution
controlled by the bank holding company as of the quarter ending
immediately prior to the proposed filing, based on a comparison of
the average total risk-weighted assets controlled during the
previous 12-month period by each insured depository institution
subsidiary of the holding company.<a href="#Footnote12" title="Footnote 12" name="Footref12"><SUP>12</SUP></a> <br>
<p>
<i>Foreign banking organizations</i> -- The following principles apply for
determining whether the lead insured depository institution for a
foreign banking organization is well-capitalized for purposes of
meeting the qualifying criteria: <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;A U.S. branch or agency of a foreign banking
organization is considered to be an insured depository institution. 
The lead insured depository institution for a foreign banking
organization that maintains branches (insured and uninsured),
agencies, and subsidiary insured depository institutions in the
United States is the individual branch, agency, or subsidiary
insured depository institution that is largest in terms of average
risk-weighted assets. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banking
organizations are not required to report assets on a risk-weighted
basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a foreign banking organization does not provide the
actual assets of its U.S. branches and agencies on a risk-weighted basis in its notice, staff should employ the conservative
estimation methodology shown in the attachment to this letter to
identify the lead insured depository institution of the foreign
banking organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;In any instance where the estimation
methodology reveals a close determination, the Reserve Bank
should contact the foreign banking organization to obtain more
definitive information. <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) &nbsp;A U.S. branch or agency of a foreign banking
organization is deemed to have the same capital ratios as the
consolidated foreign banking organization as determined under the
well-capitalized criterion discussed above. <br>
<p>
<li><i>Well-capitalized insured depository institutions must control at
least 80 percent of the aggregate total risk-weighted assets of
insured depository institutions controlled by the acquiring bank
holding company.</i> <br>
<p>
<i>Calculation of the 80 percent  test -- </i> This test identifies insured
depository institutions that comprise 80&nbsp;percent of the risk-weighted assets held by insured depository institutions controlled
by the holding company.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonbanking subsidiaries that are not
insured depository institutions are not included in calculating
compliance with this criterion.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a bank holding
company with one subsidiary bank that controls $8&nbsp;billion in risk-weighted assets, with six other subsidiary banks that each control
$200&nbsp;million in risk-weighted assets, and with uninsured
nonbanking subsidiaries with $8&nbsp;billion in risk-weighted assets
would qualify under this criterion if the $8&nbsp;billion bank is well-capitalized. <br>
<p>
<i>Foreign banking organizations</i> -- As noted above, all branches,
agencies and subsidiary insured depository institutions operated in
the United States by a foreign banking organization must be
considered in determining qualification under this criterion.<a href="#Footnote13" title="Footnote 13" name="Footref13"><SUP>13</SUP></a>  If the
Reserve Bank has concerns that this criterion is not satisfied using
the conservative estimation methodology in the attachment to this
letter, the Reserve Bank should contact the foreign banking
organization to obtain more definitive information. <br>
<p>
<li><i>No insured depository institution controlled by the acquiring bank
holding company or foreign banking organization may be
undercapitalized</i>. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Managerial criteria</b> -- The managerial criteria must be met at the time of
the transaction.<a href="#Footnote14" title="Footnote 14" name="Footref14"><SUP>14</SUP></a> <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><i>The acquiring bank holding company must be well-managed.</i> <br>
<p>
<i>Definition of well-managed</i> -- The acquiring bank holding company
must have received:&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a composite BOPEC rating of 1 or 2 at
the most recent inspection or subsequent review;<a href="#Footnote15" title="Footnote 15" name="Footref15"><SUP>15</SUP></a> <b>and</b> (b)a
satisfactory rating for management and for compliance, where
these ratings are given.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<p>
<i>Foreign banking organization</i>s -- A foreign banking organization is
deemed to be well-managed if the combined operations of the
foreign banking organization in the United States have received a
rating of 1 or 2 (derived from the Summary of Condition) at the
most recent annual assessment. <br>
<p>
If a bank holding company or a foreign banking organization has
not received a rating, see the guidance provided in paragraph
(B)(5) below.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>
<p>
<li><i>The lead insured depository institution of the acquiring bank
holding company must be well-managed</i>.<a href="#Footnote16" title="Footnote 16" name="Footref16"><SUP>16</SUP></a> <br>
<p>
At its most recent examinations for safety and soundness and
consumer compliance or subsequent review by the AFBA, the
lead insured depository institution must have received:&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;a
composite rating of 1 or 2; <b>and</b> (b) at least a satisfactory rating for
management and for consumer compliance, where these ratings
are given. <br>
<p>
<i>Foreign banking organizations</i> -- The U.S. branch or agency of a
foreign banking organization that meets the lead insured
depository institution test must have received:&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;A supervisory composite rating of 1 or 2 under the
ROCA rating system;  <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;A compliance rating of 1 or 2 (<i>i.e.</i>, the &quot;C&quot; component
in the ROCA rating must be a 1 or 2); <b>and</b>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) &nbsp;A consumer compliance rating of 1 or 2, where these
ratings are given. <br>
<p>
<li><i>Insured depository institutions that control at least 80 percent of
the total risk-weighted assets of insured depository institutions
controlled by the acquiring bank holding company must be well-managed.</i>
<p>
The 80&nbsp;percent test for the well-managed criteria should be
calculated in the same manner as discussed in paragraph (A)(3)
above for the well-capitalized criteria. <br>
<p>
At the most recent examinations for safety and soundness and
consumer compliance or subsequent reviews by the AFBA, the
insured depository institutions must have received:&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a
composite rating of 1 or 2; <b>and</b> (b) at least a satisfactory rating for
management and for consumer compliance, where these ratings
are given.
<p>
<i>Foreign banking organizations</i> -- U.S. branches and agencies of a
foreign banking organization included in the 80 percent test must
have received:<a href="#Footnote17" title="Footnote 17" name="Footref17"><SUP>17</SUP></a> <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Supervisory composite ratings of 1 or 2 under the
ROCA rating system;  <br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;Compliance ratings of 1 or 2 (<i>i.e.</i>, the &quot;C&quot; component in
the ROCA rating must be a 1 or 2); <b>and</b>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) &nbsp;Consumer compliance ratings of 1 or 2, where these
ratings are given. <br>
<p>
As noted above, all branches, agencies and subsidiary insured
depository institutions operated in the United States by a foreign
banking organization must be considered in determining
qualification under this criterion.<a href="#Footnote18" title="Footnote 18" name="Footref18"><SUP>18</SUP></a>  If the Reserve Bank has
concerns that this criterion is not satisfied using the conservative
estimation methodology in the attachment to this letter, the
Reserve Bank should contact the foreign banking organization to
obtain more definitive information. <br>
<p>
<li><i>No insured depository institution controlled by the acquiring bank
holding company may have received one of the two lowest
composite ratings at the later of the institution's most recent safety
and soundness examination or subsequent review by the AFBA
for the institution.</i> <br>
<p>
There is one <b>exception</b> to this criterion.<br>
<p>
Any insured depository institution that has been acquired by the
bank holding company during the 12 month period preceding the
date on which the notice is filed may be excluded from this
criterion (but not from the 80&nbsp;percent criterion in paragraph&nbsp;(B)(3)
above) if:&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;the bank holding company has developed a plan
acceptable to the AFBA for the insured depository institution to
restore the capital and management of the institution; and (b) all
insured depository institutions that are excluded, in the aggregate,
control less than 10 percent of the aggregate total risk-weighted
assets of all insured depository institutions controlled by the
acquiring bank holding company. <br>
<p>
<li><i>If a company or insured depository institution has not received an
inspection or examination rating, the Reserve Bank, in
consultation with Board staff and based on all available
information, may determine whether the organization is well-managed.</i> <br>
<p>
Applying the well-managed criterion in the absence of an
inspection or examination rating requires the exercise of
reasonable discretion in light of all available information.&nbsp;&nbsp;For
example, the Reserve Bank could reasonably conclude, in the
absence of any adverse information, that a shell bank holding with
no debt or activities is well-managed if its subsidiary bank is
deemed to be well-managed and in satisfactory financial condition. 
The Reserve Bank also could support a determination that a
newly formed organization is well-managed if management's prior
record at other insured depository institutions is satisfactory.
<p>
In consulting with Board staff, the Reserve Bank should provide
information supporting its position as to whether the organization
should be considered well-managed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be done as
early in the processing period as possible. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Supervisory actions criterion</b> -- <i>During the 12 month period ending on
the date on which the bank holding company proposes to consummate
the proposed transaction, no formal administrative order, including a
written agreement, cease and desist order, capital directive, prompt
corrective action directive, asset maintenance agreement, or other formal
enforcement action is or was outstanding against the bank holding
company or any insured depository institution subsidiary of the holding
company, and no formal administrative enforcement proceeding involving
any such enforcement action, order, or directive is or was pending.</i>
<p>
An administrative enforcement action is outstanding once it is issued or
executed.&nbsp;&nbsp;An administrative enforcement proceeding is pending during
the period if the bank holding company or insured depository institution is
considering agreeing to the formal action or is seeking to contest the
issuance of an order or to appeal an already issued order.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserve
Banks should consult with the AFBA of the insured depository institution
as needed to confirm compliance with this criterion. <br>
<p>
This criterion focuses on formal actions, and a bank holding company is
not automatically disqualified based on an informal action, such as a
memorandum of understanding or letter agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reserve Bank
or Board may, nevertheless, notify a bank holding company that the
30/60 day procedures should be followed if the circumstances
surrounding a memorandum of understanding, letter agreement or other
informal action indicate that more in-depth review of the proposal or
notificant or company involved is warranted. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Additional Criteria for the 10 Day Post Notice Procedures</b> <br>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<b><li>Regulatory laundry list</b> -- To qualify for the procedure allowing after-the-fact notice, a bank holding company must engage in the relevant
activity <i>de&nbsp;novo</i>, and the activity must be on the regulatory laundry list. <br>
<p>
<b><li>Compliance with criteria</b> -- A bank holding company must comply with
all of the qualifying criteria at the time it commences the nonbanking
activity.<a href="#Footnote19" title="Footnote 19" name="Footref19"><SUP>19</SUP></a>   In addition, the bank holding company must at all times
conduct the activity in conformance with the Board's regulations,
interpretations and orders governing the particular activity. <br>
<p>
<b><li>Notice to the System</b> -- A bank holding company must file written notice
with the appropriate Reserve Bank within 10 business days after
commencing the <i>de&nbsp;novo</i> regulatory laundry list activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Additional Criteria for the 12 Day Prior Notice Procedures</b>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<b><li>Permissible activity criteria</b> -- <i>The Board has determined by regulation
or order that each activity proposed to be conducted is so closely related
to banking, or managing or controlling banks, as to be a proper incident
thereto and the Board has not indicated that proposals to engage in the
activity are subject to the notice procedures procedure provided in
&#167;&nbsp;225.24</i>. <br>
<p>
The 12 day prior notice procedures are available to a qualifying bank
holding company that seeks to engage <i>de&nbsp;novo</i> in a nonbanking activity
that is permitted by order, as well as proposals to acquire certain
companies engaged in activities that have been found to be permissible
either by regulation or by order.&nbsp;&nbsp;A bank holding company that proposes
to commence <i>de&nbsp;novo</i> both activities that are on the regulatory laundry
list and activities that have been permitted only by order may use the
12&nbsp;day prior notice procedure for all of the proposed activities. <br>
<p>
In general, activities approved by Board order are eligible for the 12&nbsp;day
prior notice procedures if the Board has delegated the authority to
approve the activities to the Reserve Banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some activities that raise
policy and supervisory considerations, like notices to underwrite and deal
in corporate debt and equity securities through section 20 subsidiaries,
continue, for now, to be subject  to the 60 day notice procedures in
section 225.24 of Regulation Y.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reserve Bank should consult with
Board staff if questions are raised regarding the eligibility of a particular
activity for the streamlined procedures. <br>
<p>
<b><li>Competitive criteria for the acquisition of a going concern</b> -- <i>Without
regard to any divestitures proposed by the acquiring bank holding
company, the acquisition may not cause, in any relevant market,  the
acquiring bank holding company to control more than 35 percent of the
market share or the Herfindahl-Hirschman index to increase by more
than 200 points with a post acquisition index of 1800 points or more.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, the Board must not have indicated that the transaction is
subject to close scrutiny on competitive grounds</i>. <br>
<p>
The competitive criteria are not intended to alter the scope of review
currently conducted by the Reserve Bank under delegated authority for
section 4 proposals.&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the relevant geographic markets for
many nonbanking activities have been determined by the Board to be
national.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some relevant markets for nonbanking activities like mortgage
lending, however, remain local or regional.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other activities may raise
questions regarding the appropriate product market.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reserve Bank
should consult with Board staff on issues regarding the appropriate
analysis for considering the competitive effects of a proposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
<b><li>Size of acquisition criteria</b> <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><i>Limited growth</i> -- In the case of an acquisition, the sum of the
aggregate risk-weighted assets to be acquired in the proposal and
the aggregate risk-weighted assets acquired by the acquiring bank
holding company in all transactions approved during the previous
12&nbsp;months under the streamlined procedures governing
acquisitions of banks (section 225.14) and the streamlined
procedures governing acquisitions of nonbanking companies
(section 225.23) may not exceed 35&nbsp;percent of the consolidated
risk-weighted assets of the acquiring bank holding company at the
beginning of the 12&nbsp;month period. <br>
<p>
Transactions that were approved under the 30/60 day procedures
are excluded in calculating compliance with the criterion.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
12&nbsp;month period is a rolling period that looks back from the date
that each notice/application is filed under the streamlined
procedures and is not restarted from the date that a transaction is
approved under the 30/60 day procedures. <br>
<p>
<i>Small bank holding companies</i> -- The 35 percent limitation does
not apply if, immediately following consummation of the proposed
transaction, the consolidated risk-weighted assets of the acquiring
bank holding company are less than $300&nbsp;million. <br>
<p>
<li><i>Consideration paid</i> -- The gross consideration to be paid by the
acquiring bank holding company in the proposal may not exceed
15&nbsp;percent of the consolidated Tier 1 capital of the bank holding
company.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gross consideration encompasses all value paid in the
proposal, including cash and the value of any stock exchanged or
paid.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p>
<li><i>Size limitation on individual transactions -- The total risk-weighted
assets that the holding company proposes to acquire may not
exceed $7.5 billion.</i> <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li></b><i>The Board or Reserve Bank  has not notified the bank holding company
before action is required under the 12 day prior notice procedures that a
notice under the 30/60 day procedures is required in order to permit
closer review of any potential adverse effect or other matter related to
the factors required to be considered under section 4 of the BHC Act.</i>
<p>
This criterion underscores a key aspect of the streamlined procedures,
which is the recognition that a proposal can meet all of the qualifying
criteria and nevertheless require a closer review under the 30/60 day
procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a proposal may raise permissibility issues or
issues regarding the form of the proposed commitments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the
structure of a transaction may raise a novel interpretative or policy issue
under the BHC Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some nonbanking activities may raise issues
regarding the appropriate product market for evaluating the competitive
effect of the proposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the proposal may raise supervisory
questions about the bank holding company's risk management systems
or the managerial resources available to conduct the proposed activity. 
The level of acquisition debt may also raise supervisory concerns, and
information from the primary banking supervisor or the home country
supervisor of a foreign banking organization may raise issues regarding
the financial or managerial resources of the organization that have not
yet been reflected in the organization's most recent rating.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<p>
If any issue is raised by a proposal that requires a closer review, the
notice should be processed under the 30/60 day procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying
these issues early in the process will preserve the goals of the
streamlined procedures without imposing undue burden on the notificant. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Procedures</b><br>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<b><li>Filing Requirements</b> -- Notices filed under the streamlined procedures
must be in writing and contain the information listed below.&nbsp;&nbsp;A notice is
deemed to be &quot;filed&quot; with the Reserve Bank the day it is received if
received during normal business hours, or the next business day if
received after normal business hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the expedited nature of
the streamlined procedures, the Reserve Bank should not review notices
in draft. <br>
<p>
The notificant should ensure that any non-public information, including
any examination information, that may be provided appear in the
confidential portion of the proposal. <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<b><li>Contents of 10 Day Post Notice</b> <br>
<p>
(a) &nbsp;<i>A certification that all criteria are met</i> -- The form of the
certification may be a single sentence in the notice in which the
notificant certifies that all of the criteria in section 225.23 of
Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23) are met.&nbsp;&nbsp;The certification may be
provided by anyone with knowledge and authority to bind the
applying bank holding company, including legal counsel for or
executive officers of the holding company.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certification by the
board of directors of the holding company also is acceptable, but
is not necessary. <br>
<p>
(b) &nbsp;<i>Description of the proposal</i> -- Contents: <br>
<p>
<ul>
(1) &nbsp;identification of the company or companies engaged in
the activity(ies); <br>
<p>
(2) &nbsp;a description of the activity(ies) conducted; and <br>
<p>
(3) &nbsp;a commitment to conduct the proposed activity(ies) in
conformity with the Board's regulations and orders
governing the conduct of the proposed activity. <br>
</ul>
<p>
<b><li>Contents of 12 Day Prior Notice</b>
<p>
(a) &nbsp;<i>A certification that all criteria are met</i> -- The form of the
certification may be a single sentence in the notice in which the
notificant certifies that all of the criteria in section 225.23 of
Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23) are met.&nbsp;&nbsp;The certification may be
provided by anyone with knowledge and authority to bind the
applying bank holding company, including legal counsel for or
executive officers of the holding company.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certification by the
board of directors of the holding company also is acceptable, but
is not necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notificants are not required to furnish
examination ratings as part of the certification or regulatory filing
since these ratings are already available to the System. <br>
<p>
(b) &nbsp;<i>Description of the proposal</i> -- Contents:<br>
<p>
<ul>
(1) &nbsp;identification of the company or companies engaged in
the activity(ies);<br>
<p>
(2) &nbsp;a description of the activity(ies) conducted; and <br>
<p>
(3) &nbsp;a commitment to conduct the proposed activity(ies) in
conformity with the Board's regulations and orders
governing the conduct of the proposed activity. <br>
</ul>
<p>
(c) &nbsp;<i>Financial information  -- going concern</i>
<p>
<ul>
(1) &nbsp;If the acquiring bank holding company has consolidated
assets of <b>$150 million or more</b>, the notice must contain (i)
an abbreviated consolidated <i>pro&nbsp;forma</i> balance sheet, as of
the most recent quarter, showing <i>pro&nbsp;forma</i> credit and debit
adjustments; (ii)&nbsp;consolidated <i>pro&nbsp;forma</i> risk-based capital
ratios for the acquiring bank holding company as of the
most recent quarter; (iii) a description of the purchase price
and the terms and sources of funding for the transaction;
and (iv) the total revenue and net income of the company
to be acquired. <br>
<p>
(2) &nbsp;If the acquiring bank holding company has consolidated
assets of <b>less than $150 million</b>, the notice must contain (i)
a <i>pro&nbsp;forma</i> parent only balance sheet, as of the most
recent quarter, showing credit and debit adjustments; (ii) a
description of the purchase price, the terms and sources of
funding for the transaction; (iii)&nbsp;the sources and schedule
for retiring any debt incurred in the transaction; and (iv) the
total assets, off-balance sheet items, revenue and net
income of the company to be acquired. <br>
<p>
(3) &nbsp;<i>Pro&nbsp;forma</i> total risk-weighted assets, total assets, Tier&nbsp;1
capital, and total capital for each insured depository
institution whose Tier 1 capital, total capital, total assets or
risk-weighted assets would change upon consummation of
the proposal. <br>
</ul>
<p>
(d) &nbsp;<i>Competition</i> -- Identification of the relevant geographic
markets, a description of the effects of the proposal in these
markets, a list of the major competitors in the proposed activity (if
the relevant geographic market is local), and, if requested, market
indexes for the relevant markets. <br>
<p>
In reviewing cases under the streamlined procedures, the Reserve
Bank should use market definitions approved or adopted by the
Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a notificant proposes an alternative market definition, the
Reserve Bank should consult with Board staff to determine
whether the proposal (and the proposed market definition) are
more appropriately reviewed under the 30/60 day procedures. <br>
<p>
A notificant is <b>not</b> required to provide HHI calculations for
nonbanking acquisition proposals.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Reserve Bank
should request that the notificant provide HHI calculations if other
information available indicates that the effect on competition may
be significant in any relevant market. <br>
<p>
(e) &nbsp;<i>Public Benefits</i> -- A description of the public benefits that can
reasonably be expected to result from the proposal. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Waiver of unnecessary information</b> -- The Reserve Bank may reduce
the financial and competitive information that must be provided in
response to paragraphs(A)(2)(c) and (d) above  if the information is
clearly not needed to assess compliance with the qualifying criteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;For
example, a waiver of some of the financial information may be granted if
the size and scope of a proposed transaction is clearly insignificant
relative to the size and scope of the acquiring bank holding company's
existing operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Waivers of information do not need to be made in
writing, though it is advisable that the Reserve Banks document the
reasons for granting the waivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;If information is waived, the Reserve
Bank must assure that information is contained in the record (<i>e.g.</i>, the
same information was obtained from another source, the information has
already been obtained by the Reserve Bank from notificant in a previous
transaction, or sufficient alternate information was provided by notificant)
to assure that the qualifying criteria can be verified. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Reserve Bank Processing</b>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<b><li>Determination that criteria are met</b> <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><i>10 day post notice</i> -- The Reserve Bank must determine
immediately that the qualifying criteria are met.&nbsp;&nbsp;A notice that
conforms to the 10&nbsp;day post notice procedures must be
acknowledged by the Reserve Bank within a reasonable period of
time (typically within 7&nbsp;calendar days), and a copy should be
provided to supervisory staff for use in examining the bank holding
company.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a copy of the notice and a copy of the
acknowledgement letter mailed by the Reserve Bank should be
sent to the BS&amp;R Clearing Unit. <br>
<p>
<li><i>12 day prior notice</i> -- Immediately following the filing of a 12 day
prior notice, the Reserve Bank must determine, based on
information contained in the notice and other information available
to the System, whether all of the qualifying criteria are met.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Reserve Bank should provide copies of the notice to Board staff
on receipt in order that copies of the notice may be made publicly
available by the Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Reserve Bank should
consult with Board staff promptly, as needed, to verify that the
proposed activity is consistent in all respects to the particular
activity approved by the Board. <br>
<p>
(a) &nbsp;<i>No public notice</i> -- No public notice is required for proposals
that qualify for the 12 day prior notice procedures.<a href="#Footnote20" title="Footnote 20" name="Footref20"><SUP>20</SUP></a>  However, as
noted below, public notice is required for proposals that do not
qualify for the 12 day prior notice procedures. <br>
<p>
(b) &nbsp;<i>Incomplete notice</i> -- The Reserve Bank may return a notice as
incomplete within 3 business days of receipt of the notice if the
notificant has not provided all information required by Regulation Y
for expedited processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the bank holding company
will not be expected to provide additional information to ensure
that the qualifying criteria are satisfied, other than the information
required above.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, however, the Reserve Bank determines that
more information is necessary to determine whether the notice
meets the qualifying criteria, the Reserve Bank may make a
specific request for supporting information.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that
such requests would be rare, and that the processing would not
be tolled, even with the consent of the notificant. <br>
<p>
(c) &nbsp;<i>Action on notice</i> -- A notice that meets all the qualifying
criteria and does not raise any issues must be approved by the
Reserve Bank before the end of the 12&nbsp;business day period that
begins on the day following the day the notice is filed. <br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Failure to meet qualifying criteria</b> <br>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li><i>10 day post notice</i> -- If any of the qualifying criteria are not met,
the Reserve Bank should notify the bank holding company of the
problem as soon as practicable, and provide guidance, if possible,
on what information would be required to bring the notice into
compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the notice cannot be conformed because, for
example, the activity is not on the regulatory laundry list, the
notice is substantially late, or other factors suggest supervisory
action is appropriate, the Reserve Bank should take supervisory
action that would be appropriate for a bank holding company
engaging in unauthorized nonbanking activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;These actions
may include ordering immediate termination of the activity, fines,
cease and desist orders or other appropriate measures. <br>
<p>
<li><i>12 day prior notice</i> -- If any of the qualifying criteria are not met,
a notice under the 30/60 day procedure in section 225.24 of
Regulation Y (12&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;225.24), is required.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the
Reserve Bank should notify the bank holding company in writing
(and by telephone if appropriate) as soon as possible, and in any
event before the expiration of the 12 business day processing
period, that a notice under the 30/60 day procedures will be
required. <br>
<p>
(a) &nbsp;<i>In-depth review</i> -- As noted above, the Reserve Bank may
require the filing of a notice under the 30/60 day process if a
proposal raises a supervisory, competitive, legal or other issue
that warrants in-depth review even if the bank holding company
meets the qualifying criteria for streamlined processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this
case, the Reserve Bank should notify the notificant immediately. <br>
<p>
(b) &nbsp;<i>Processing under normal procedures</i> -- Within one two
business days after determining that a proposal requires
processing under the 30/60 day procedures, the Reserve Bank
shall wire a <i>Federal&nbsp;Register</i> notice to the Board's Legal Division,
and the Reserve Bank should confirm receipt of the wire.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
proposal shall be considered to have been accepted under the
30/60 day procedures as of the date that notice was filed under
the 12&nbsp;day prior notice procedures. <br>
<p>
For notices that have been transferred from the streamlined to the
30/60 day processing schedule, Reserve Bank and Board staff
should determine whether information from the notificant
supplementing the streamlined filing is necessary to address
relevant issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserve Bank or Board staff may request the
additional information at the time notificant is notified of the
processing change, or at any time during the processing period.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</ol>
<p>
<b><li>Processing delegated to Secretary</b> -- Proposals that require action by
the Secretary of the Board may be eligible for processing under the
streamlined procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reserve Bank should indicate if a proposal
requires processing by Board staff. <br>
</ol>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each bank holding company, including a foreign banking organization, is
responsible for certifying compliance with the requirement that the company and
insured depository institutions controlled by the company are well-capitalized and
well-managed. &nbsp;If a foreign banking organization does not provide the actual assets of
its U.S. branches and agencies on a risk-weighted basis in its application, the Reserve
Bank should use the conservative estimation methodology, discussed below, to
estimate the risk-weighted assets of such institutions. &nbsp;In performing these calculations
for U.S. branches and agencies, the Reserve Bank should review existing in-house
data filed by the foreign banking organization (<i>i.e.</i>, FFIEC 031, 032, 033, 034, and/or
002 reports). &nbsp;If the results of the Reserve Bank's calculations using those data and
methodology reveal a close determination, the Reserve Bank should contact the
foreign banking organization to obtain more definitive information.<br>

<P>
<a name="Footnote2">2.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The 30/60 day section 4 procedures are set forth in section 225.24 of Regulation&nbsp;Y (12 CFR 225.24).&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref2">Return to text</a>

<P>
<a name="Footnote3">3.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>See</b> section 225.28 of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.28) for the regulatory &quot;laundry list&quot; of approved nonbanking activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref3">Return to text</a>

<P>
<a name="Footnote4">4.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>See</b> section 225.132 of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.132) for guidance on when the acquisition of assets constitutes the acquisition of a going concern thereby requiring a notice under section 4 of the BHC Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref4">Return to text</a>

<P>
<a name="Footnote5">5.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with proposals involving acquisitions, Reserve Bank staff should be alert to acquisitions of companies that have foreign operations since it may require a separate filing under the procedures and requirements of Regulation&nbsp;K.&nbsp;&nbsp;If domestic and foreign aspects of the proposal cannot be separated, and the proposal does not qualify for expedited or consent provisions of Regulation&nbsp;K, the proposal may have to be processed under the 30/60 day procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref5">Return to text</a>

<P>

<a name="Footnote6">6.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals involving a savings association or other nonbank insured depository institution must be filed under section 4, but may be processed following the streamlined section 3 procedures if the bank holding company and the proposal meet all applicable criteria as if the nonbank institution were a bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>See</b> SR letter on Streamlined Section 3 Procedures for Well-Capitalized and Well-Managed Banking Organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;A bank holding company may also continue to have these proposals processed under the 30/60 day section 4 procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref6">Return to text</a>
<P>

<a name="Footnote7">7.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a bank holding company is part of a chain banking organization, the criteria for the streamlined procedures will generally apply only to the bank holding company involved in the proposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be circumstances, however, when it is appropriate to evaluate the proposal in light of the entire organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the overall financial condition of the chain organization may require a closer review of the financial aspects of the proposal under the 30/60 day procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such cases, the Reserve Bank should consult with Board staff on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref7">Return to text</a>

<P>
<a name="Footnote8">8.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial criteria for streamlined section 4 proposals under section 225.23 of Regulation Y are the same as those used for streamlined section 3 proposals under section 225.14 of the regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref8">Return to text</a>

<P>
<a name="Footnote9">9.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;A bank holding company must meet the well-capitalized criterion on a <b>consolidated</b> basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-capitalized bank holding company criterion generally will not apply to intermediate-tier bank holding companies involved in the transaction, although the 30/60 day procedures may be used if there are concerns about the financial strength of an intermediate-tier bank holding company.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref9">Return to text</a>

<P>
<a name="Footnote10">10.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;Home country supervisor&quot; means the governmental entity or entities in the foreign bank's home country with responsibility for the supervision and regulation of the foreign bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref10">Return to text</a>

<P>
<a name="Footnote12">12.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Average risk-weighted assets may be calculated using the total risk-weighted assets reported for the previous four quarters.&nbsp;&nbsp;If average risk-weighted assets are not provided in a notice involving a foreign banking organization with a U.S. branch or agency, the calculation may be performed by the Reserve Bank by taking the average of the quarterly risk-weighted assets derived using the conservative methodology appearing in the attachment to this letter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other methodologies may be appropriate in situations where financial data are limited or not current.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref12">Return to text</a>

<P>

<P>
<a name="Footnote15">15.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The term &quot;subsequent review&quot; means a rating change by the AFBA between full scope inspections/examinations, where the holding company or insured depository institution has been notified of the rating change.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref15">Return to text</a>

<P>
<a name="Footnote18">18.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the foreign banking organization operates a subsidiary insured depository institution in the United States, the Reserve Bank should consider the composite rating and rating for management and compliance given at the institution's most recent examination or subsequent review, as discussed in paragraph (B)(3) above.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref18">Return to text</a>

<P>
<a name="Footnote19">19.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The 10 day post notice procedure requires a bank holding company to have commenced the activity at the time it provides notice to the System, and therefore may not be used for <i>de&nbsp;novo</i> activities on the regulatory laundry list proposed to be commenced in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;A bank holding company may use the 12 day prior procedure or the 30/60 day procedures to obtain approval to commence a laundry list activity in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Footref19">Return to text</a>
