<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Interagency 
   Advisory Concerning the Legal Protections Associated 
   with the Filing of Suspicious Activity Reports</div>
<p>Federal law provides protection from civil liability 
   to financial institutions and their employees who 
   report suspicious or potentially criminal activity 
   to the appropriate law enforcement and bank supervisory 
   authorities in Suspicious Activity Reports&nbsp;(SARs). 
   A recent federal court case reaffirmed the scope 
   of this statutory protection, which is generally 
   referred to as a &quot;safe harbor.&quot; The enforcement 
   staffs of the Federal Reserve Board and the other 
   federal financial institutions supervisory agencies, 
   along with the U.S. Department of the Treasury's 
   Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, prepared an 
   Interagency Advisory discussing the facts, holding, 
   and implications of the court decision. A copy of 
   the Interagency&nbsp;Advisory is attached. </p>
<p>In addition to a discussion of the case and the background 
   of the &quot;safe harbor&quot; provisions, the Interagency 
   Advisory also provides useful information regarding 
   steps that banking organizations should take to better 
   ensure that they are fully protected under the law. 
   Most importantly, the Advisory states that, in the 
   opinion of the staffs of the banking agencies, financial 
   institutions and their employees who follow their 
   respective agencies' SAR regulations and the filing 
   instructions should be fully protected by the &quot;safe 
   harbor&quot; provisions of federal law. </p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this SR&nbsp;letter 
   and the attached Interagency Advisory to the state 
   member banks, bank holding companies, and foreign 
   banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve 
   in their districts, as well as to their supervisory 
   and examination staff. Questions pertaining to this 
   letter should be directed to Herbert&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Biern, 
   Senior Associate Director, at (202)&nbsp;452-2620, 
   Nina&nbsp;Nichols, Special Counsel, at (202)&nbsp;452-2961, 
   or to John&nbsp;McCormick, Special Counsel, at (202)&nbsp;728-5829,
