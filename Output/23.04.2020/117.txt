<p>The Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Securities and Exchange 
   Commission, and Office of the Comptroller of the 
   Currency have published the attached <i>Interagency 
   Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience 
   of the U.S. Financial System</i>. The white paper 
   is part of the interagency effort to improve the 
   resilience of the private-sector clearing and settlement 
   infrastructure after September&nbsp;11 and ensure 
   the smooth operation of the financial system in the 
   event of a wide-scale disruption. As discussed below, 
   the sound practices apply most directly to organizations 
   that are deemed to present a type of systemic risk 
   to U.S. financial markets should they not be able 
   to complete open transactions. Nevertheless, all 
   banking organizations and other financial market 
   participants are encouraged to review and consider 
   implementation of the sound practices, particularly 
   if a firm's transaction levels approach those deemed 
   to be significant.</p>
<p>The following is an overview of the paper. </p>
<p><b>Scope</b>. The sound practices articulated in 
   the attached paper expressly apply to &quot;core 
   clearing and settlement organizations&quot; and &quot;financial 
   institutions that play significant roles in critical 
   financial markets.&quot; These two groups pose a 
   type of systemic risk should they be unable to recover 
   or resume critical activities that support critical 
   markets.<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
   Core clearing and settlement organizations are defined 
   as large-value payment system operators and market 
   utilities that provide critical clearing and settlement 
   services for critical financial markets. The term 
   also includes firms that provide clearing and settlement 
   services that are integral to a critical financial 
   market (i.e.,&nbsp;their market share is significant 
   enough to present systemic risk in the event of their 
   sudden failure to carry on those activities because 
   there are no viable immediate substitutes). Firms 
   that play significant roles in critical financial 
   markets are those that consistently clear or settle 
   at least five&nbsp;percent of the value of transactions 
   in a critical market. To allay any<font face="Arial"> 
   </font>confusion, the agencies are contacting each 
   firm that appears to meet the market share thresholds. 
   If they conclude that the firm plays a significant 
   role in one or more critical markets, the aforementioned 
   agencies will review the firm's plans for implementing 
   the sound practices. </p>
<p><b>Sound Practices</b>. The paper describes four&nbsp;sound 
   practices that pertain to appropriate back-up capacity 
   for operations sites and data centers for the recovery 
   and resumption of clearance and settlement activities 
   in critical (wholesale) financial markets. The paper 
   does not apply to recovery or resumption of retail 
   financial services or require firms to enter into 
   new transactions. The critical financial markets 
   are defined as the markets for federal funds, foreign 
   exchange, commercial paper, corporate equities and 
   bonds, and government, agency and mortgage-backed 
   securities. The four&nbsp;sound practices are: </p>
<ol class="indent">
   <li><b><i>Identify all the critical clearing and 
      settlement activities in support of critical financial 
      market</i>s. </b>These activities include the 
      completion of pending large-value payments; clearance 
      and settlement of material pending transactions;<sup> 
      </sup>meeting material end-of-day funding and 
      collateral obligations necessary to ensure the 
      performance; and updating records of accounts.</li>
   <li><b><i>Determine the appropriate recovery and 
      resumption time objectives for critical clearing 
      and settlement activities in support of critical 
      financial markets</i>.</b> The paper establishes 
      a &quot;within the business day&quot; recovery 
      time objective for both core clearing organizations 
      and significant firms. Core clearing and settlement 
      organizations are expected to develop the capacity 
      to <i>recover and resume</i> clearing and settlement 
      activities within the business day on which the 
      disruption occurs with the overall recovery goal 
      of two&nbsp;hours after an event. Firms that play 
      significant roles should plan to <i>recover</i> 
      clearing and settlement activities as soon as 
      possible after the core clearing and settlement 
      organizations and within the business day on which 
      a disruption occurs. Such firms should strive 
      to achieve a four-hour recovery time capability 
      in order to ensure that they will be able to meet 
      a within-the-business-day recovery target. The 
      two and four-hour recovery time targets are benchmarks 
      for planning and testing recovery arrangements, 
      and recognize the broad range of variables (e.g.,&nbsp;timing, 
      scope, and condition of critical infrastructure) 
      that could affect a firm's actual recovery time 
      in a wide-scale disruption.</li>
   <li><b><i>Maintain sufficient geographically dispersed 
      resources to meet recovery and resumption objectives</i>.</b> 
      Back-up arrangements should be as far away from 
      the primary site as necessary to avoid being subject 
      to the same set of risks as the primary location 
      and should not rely on the same infrastructure 
      components used by the primary site. The paper 
      does not specify any specific mileage or staffing 
      requirements for implementing this sound practice, 
      and does not recommend that firms move their primary 
      offices, operating sites, or data centers out 
      of metropolitan locations. However, core clearing 
      organizations are expected to establish back-up 
      facilities a significant distance away from primary 
      sites, even if they find it necessary to establish 
      a tertiary site. Firms that play significant roles 
      can meet this sound practice by establishing sites 
      that are within the current range limit of synchronous 
      data storage technology. An organization that 
      uses synchronous back-up facilities or whose back-up 
      sites depend primarily on the same labor pool 
      as the primary site is expected to address the 
      risk that a wide-scale disruption could impact 
      either or both of the sites and their labor pools. 
      Moreover, firms with such back-up arrangements 
      should strive to develop even more distant back-up 
      arrangements as part of their ongoing planning 
      process.</li>
   <li><b><i>Routinely use or test recovery and resumption 
      arrangements</i></b>. This includes regular tests 
      of internal recovery and resumption arrangements 
      as well as cross-organization tests to ensure 
      the effectiveness and compatibility of recovery 
      and resumption strategies within and across critical 
      markets.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Implementation of Sound Practices</b>. The paper 
   calls for substantial implementation of the sound 
   practices as soon as practicable and establishes 
   implementation time frames. Core clearing and settlement 
   organizations are expected to achieve substantially 
   the sound practices by the end of&nbsp;2004. The 
   paper recognizes that some core clearing organizations 
   can be given additional flexibility in establishing 
   back-up facilities that are well outside of the current 
   synchronous data storage range if they take near-term 
   steps that result in substantially improved resilience. 
   Firms that play significant roles in critical financial 
   markets are expected to achieve substantially the 
   sound practices within three years of publication 
   of the paper. The paper recognizes that, in some 
   cases, a firm may find it necessary to provide for 
   a longer implementation period in light of its respective 
   risk profile, level of resilience, and unique business 
   circumstances. Plans are expected to include measurable 
   milestones to assess progress in achieving the sound 
   practices.</p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to send a copy of this SR&nbsp;letter 
   and interagency paper to senior management at domestic 
   and foreign banking organizations supervised by the 
   Federal Reserve. Reserve Banks also are asked to 
   encourage all financial firms, even those that are 
   not deemed to be a core clearing and settlement organization 
   or a firm that plays a significant role in critical 
   markets, to review and consider implementation of 
   the sound practices, particularly if a firm's transactions 
   levels approach those deemed to be significant.</p>

      <li><a name="Footnote1"></a>"Systemic risk" is 
         defined as the risk that the failure of one 
         participant in a transfer system or financial 
         market to meet its required obligations will 
         cause other participants to be unable to meet 
         their obligations when due, causing significant 
         liquidity or credit problems and threatening 
         the stability of financial markets. The definition 
         is drawn from <i>A&nbsp;glossary of terms used 
         in payment and settlement systems</i>, Committee
