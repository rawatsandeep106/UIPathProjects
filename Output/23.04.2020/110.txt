<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Guidance on 
   Change in Bank Control Procedures</div>
<p>The Federal Reserve is issuing this SR&nbsp;letter 
   to emphasize the importance of understanding the 
   requirements for filing a notice under the Change 
   in Bank Control Act. Recently, there have been some 
   inadvertent incidents of unauthorized changes of 
   ownership involving state member banks and bank holding 
   companies. It is recognized that the complexity of 
   an ownership position sometimes does not lend itself 
   to easy interpretation of the requirements to file 
   a notice. In situations in which it is unclear whether 
   a notice is required, the potential filer(s) or the 
   affected state member bank or bank holding company 
   is encouraged to contact staff at a Reserve Bank 
   or the Board for guidance. This SR&nbsp;letter identifies 
   when an individual or other affected party should 
   contact the Federal Reserve regarding the filing 
   of a notice under the Change in Bank Control Act 
   and the Board's implementing regulations.</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Transactions Requiring Prior Notice</div>
<p>Section&nbsp;225.41 of Regulation&nbsp;Y sets forth 
   the specific types of transactions that require prior 
   notice under the Change in Bank Control Act.&nbsp; 
   Prior notice is required by any person (acting directly 
   or indirectly) that seeks to acquire control of a 
   state member bank or bank holding company. A &quot;person&quot; 
   may include an individual, a group of individuals 
   acting in concert, or certain entities (e.g., corporations, 
   partnerships, trusts) that own shares of banking 
   organizations but that do not qualify as bank holding 
   companies. A person acquires &quot;control&quot; 
   of a banking organization whenever the person acquires 
   ownership, control, or the power to vote 25&nbsp;percent 
   or more of any class of voting securities of the 
   institution. Section&nbsp;225.41 of Regulation&nbsp;Y 
   outlines certain other &quot;rebuttable&quot; presumptions 
   of control that also may require the filing of a 
   notice, including (under certain circumstances) a 
   proposed acquisition that would result in the person 
   owning or controlling the power to vote 10&nbsp;percent 
   or more of any class of voting securities.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve generally must be given 60&nbsp;days 
   prior written notice of a proposed acquisition of 
   a controlling ownership interest.<a href="#Footnote1" name="Footref1" title="Footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
   A change in bank control notice should be filed with 
   the Reserve Bank in the district where the banking 
   organization to be acquired is located. The notice 
   should include biographical and financial information 
   on the filer(s); details of the proposed acquisition; 
   information on any proposed structural, managerial, 
   or financial changes that would affect the banking 
   organization to be acquired; and other relevant information 
   required by the Federal Reserve. The primary forms 
   to be completed as a part of a notice are the Interagency 
   Biographical and Financial Report form and the Interagency 
   Notice of Change in Control. The forms are available 
   through the Reserve Banks and on the Board's public 
   website at <a href="/generalinfo/applications/afi/">http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/applications/afi/</a>.</p>
<p>Filers are requested to consult with the appropriate 
   Reserve Bank to confirm what specific information 
   should be included in a particular notice. The Reserve 
   Bank will provide specialized publication material 
   that will assist the filer(s) in placing a complete 
   announcement of the proposed acquisition in the appropriate 
   newspaper of general circulation. After reviewing 
   the submitted information, the Federal Reserve may 
   initiate name checks with certain other U.S.&nbsp;government 
   agencies (including law enforcement) on some or all 
   of the individuals related to the proposal. The information 
   received from those name checks will be used to further 
   the assessment of the relevant statutory factors, 
   including the competence, experience, integrity, 
   and financial ability of the individual filers.</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Commitments and Conditions for Approval</div>
<p>Approvals granted by the Federal Reserve under the 
   Change in Bank Control Act may be subject to commitments 
   or conditions that require the filer to consult with 
   appropriate Federal Reserve staff before acquiring 
   further shares of the subject banking organization. 
   The Board or the Reserve Bank also may impose restrictions 
   on the acquisition of additional shares by any person 
   who already controls an institution. The imposition 
   of such commitments, conditions, or limitations is 
   intended to ensure that statutory factors remain 
   consistent with approval.&nbsp; </p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Transactions Not Requiring Prior Notice</div>
<p>Section&nbsp;225.42 of Regulation&nbsp;Y sets forth 
   the transactions that do not require any notice under 
   the Change in Bank Control Act or that require after-the-fact 
   notice. The transactions that do not require any 
   notice to the Federal Reserve include, but are not 
   limited to:&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;the acquisition of additional 
   shares if the acquirer is deemed to already have 
   control of the banking organization, (ii)&nbsp;any 
   acquisition subject to approval under the Bank Holding 
   Company Act or Bank Merger Act, and (iii)&nbsp;receipt 
   of voting securities as a result of a stock dividend 
   (if the proportional interest of the recipient remains 
   substantially the same). The transactions that require 
   after-the-fact notice include, among others, the 
   acquisition of voting securities through inheritance, 
   as a <i>bona&nbsp;fide</i> gift, or in satisfaction 
   of a debt previously contracted in good faith.&nbsp; 
   In these latter situations, the appropriate Reserve 
   Bank must be notified within 90&nbsp;days after the 
   acquisition, and the acquirer must provide any relevant 
   information requested by the Reserve Bank.</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Unauthorized or Undisclosed Changes in Bank Control</div>
<p>In some instances, a person acquires control of a 
   banking organization without submitting the prior 
   or after-the-fact notice required by Regulation&nbsp;Y. 
   These unauthorized or undisclosed changes in bank 
   control may not be known to the person, the state 
   member bank, or the bank holding company, but rather 
   are discovered by Reserve Bank examiners during an 
   inspection or examination of the affected institution. 
   In most cases, such a violation of the Change in 
   Bank Control Act is addressed by the person immediately 
   filing a notice to the Federal Reserve requesting 
   authority to retain the acquired shares.<a href="#Footnote2" name="Footref2" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
   The filing should include an explanation of the circumstances 
   that resulted in the violation, and a description 
   of the actions that have been (or will be) taken 
   by the filer(s) to ensure no further violations of 
   the statute. While the burden to file a timely change 
   in bank control notice is placed on the person(s) 
   acquiring control, the subject banking organization 
   may have better information than the individual(s) 
   regarding current ownership positions, including 
   shareholder lists. In view of this, it is important 
   that state member banks and bank holding companies 
   be familiar with the regulations and policies governing 
   changes in bank control, and when possible to share 
   such information with shareholders with significant 
   ownership positions.</p>
<div class="SectionHeader">Violations of the Change in Bank Control Act</div>
<p>The Federal Reserve has enforcement jurisdiction 
   over those persons who file or <u>should file</u> 
   notices under the Change in Bank Control Act. Accordingly, 
   violations of the requirement to file a change in 
   bank control notice may result in the Federal Reserve 
   taking enforcement action against the relevant person(s) 
   in appropriate circumstances, including those involving 
   willful or negligent misconduct. Violations may result 
   in the person(s) being subject to a variety of sanctions, 
   including the assessment of a civil money penalty. 
   Reserve Banks should report violations of which they 
   are aware to staff in the Board's Legal Division 
   and the Board's Division of Banking Supervision and 
   Regulation in order to ensure that appropriate corrective 
   action is taken.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Reserve Banks are asked to distribute this SR&nbsp;letter 
   to all state member banks and bank holding companies 
   in their districts, as well as their supervision 
   and applications staff. Reserve Banks should make 
   banking organizations and, to the extent possible, 
   their related shareholders aware of the resources 
   available to address change in control questions, 
   including contact persons. Examiners, other supervisory 
   staff, and applications analysts should use this 
   guidance to identify ownership changes that require 
   action by the Federal Reserve under the Change in 
   Bank Control Act.</p>
<p>Should 
   you have any questions regarding this SR&nbsp;letter, 
   please contact Betsy&nbsp;Cross, Associate Director, 
   at (202)&nbsp;452-2574; Melissa&nbsp;Clark, Senior 
   Supervisory Financial Analyst, at (202)&nbsp;452-2277; 
   Pat&nbsp;Robinson, Managing Senior Counsel, at (202)&nbsp;452-3005; 
   or Andrew&nbsp;Wiederhorn, Attorney, at (202)&nbsp;452-3564.</p>
