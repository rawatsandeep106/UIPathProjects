<div class="subject">SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of Examination Guidelines for the Review of Asset Securitization Activities </div>
<p>Banking organizations have long been involved with asset-backed <span class="nobreak">securities (ABS),</span> both as 
	investors in such securities and as major participants in the securitization process.  In recent years they have 
   stepped up their involvement by increasing their participation in the long-established market for securities backed by 
   residential mortgage loans and by expanding their securitizing activities to other types of assets, including credit 
   card receivables, automobile loans, boat loans, commercial real estate loans, student loans, nonperforming loans, and 
lease receivables.</p>
<p>It is appropriate for banking organizations to engage in securitization activities and to invest in ABS, if they do so 
	in a prudent manner.  Nonetheless, these activities can significantly affect their overall risk exposure.  It is, thus, 
   of great importance, particularly given the growth and expansion of such activities, for examiners to be fully 
   informed on the fundamentals of the securitization process, on the various risks that securitization and investing in 
   ABS can create for banking organizations, and on procedures that should be followed in examining banks and inspecting 
   bank holding companies in order to effectively assess their exposure to risk and management of that exposure.</p> 
<p>In order to provide examiners with the information and guidance they need on asset securitization, a task force of 
	System supervisory staff from the Reserve Banks and the Board was established.  The Task Force developed materials on 
   the mechanics of securitization and related accounting issues, as well as a set of examination guidelines. These draft 
   materials were distributed to you last September.  This letter transmits the final version of the examination guidelines 
   and educational background material for asset securitization.  Attached are <span class="nobreak">1) the</span> 
   Examination Guidelines, <span class="nobreak">2) An</span> Introduction to Asset Securitization &#150; 
   <span class="nobreak">Volume 1,</span> and <span class="nobreak">3) Accounting</span> Issues Relating to Asset 
   Securitization &#150; <span class="nobreak">Volume 2.</span></p>  
<p>Reserve Banks are instructed to implement the examination guidelines and procedures as of 
	<span class="nobreak">July 1, 1990.</span></p>
